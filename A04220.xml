         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riendly Reader; it were but labour in vaine to tell thee, why I made choice of this Epiſtle rather than another to to treat of. For are not all Preachers ſowers? So that if they breake vp any little cloſe, within the large pale that boundeth Gods great demaine, the holy letters, they cannot miſſe it, but keepe their compaſſe. Neither is it to any purpoſe to declare vnto thee, why theſe lines are now put to publike light. For, is not all the graine in Gods gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, good? fit for the market, and to be ſet to ſale? For, to omit many reaſons, this is the very truth; that as Prognoſticators vſually write Almanackes, to and for that Climate wherein they be reſident; ſo haue I made election of this portion, and now eſpecially pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, for that place, where and amongſt whom the Lord for a few yeares by the hand of his prouidence caſt me. Wherefore I will the rather informe thee of my method, in this ſucceeding treatiſe, the which, is this and thus.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place (may it pleaſe thee to view it) thou ſhalt finde the text Logically into its parts reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uod; next the words plainly explicated, then a familiar Metaphraſe, as we apprehend the ſenſe, annexed: And
<pb facs="tcp:972:6"/> laſt of all, the ſeuerall doctrines ariſing thence, dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And becauſe ordinarily a deduct is to be drawne, not from one ſimple, but two Arguments at the leaſt, as the<note place="margin">Rev. 10. 2,</note> the Angell is ſaid to <hi>ſet one foote on the ſea, another on the ſhore,</hi> we haue (one being in our text) for the better riſe, borrowed a ſecond from farre. But, vſuall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, either from the ſcope, and the connection; the words generally vnited, not particularly abſtracted, the doctrines be collected. And for the heads, we haue ſet them downe with little or noe amplification at all. For, to me (I am ſure) and to the Corrector, Printer, and Reader, (I iudge) it would, (had we done otherwiſe,) ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e beene more painfull, chargeable, and not much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. But we haue confirmed them at large: Firſt, By Precept: Secondly, Example: Thirdly, Reaſons: and laſt of all, we haue mixed our whole diſcourſe, with fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and delightfull ſimilitudes; for the better alluring out of the drouping affections, and the inclining of the froward will, both to embrace the truth, and put it in ſpeedy execution. By Precept, vnderſtand ſome propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equiualent to the doctrine propounded. By Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that which hath in it the force of a commaund. For, the act is concr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e with the precept, and cannot except notionally be abſtracted. For, euery good action effected, hath its rule by which it is guided. And by Reaſon, conceiue a third argument, in producing whereof, the point in hand is more ſtrongly confirmed. For, as when two colours are controuerted, we fetch a light, hold that betwixt them, by which the better is the better diſcerned by the eye of the body: So, When truth is in ſuſpence, in the producing of a third Argument, the which we call a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and diſpoſing it with the doctrine in forme of a
<pb facs="tcp:972:6"/> Syllogiſme, its the more conſpicuous to the eie of our vnderſtanding. And the reaſon we vſe Reaſons, is in that we are to deale with men who haue reaſon, but want faith. And vntill the iudgement be ſoundly convinced, the <hi>Wil</hi> will not be throughly reformed. For, as the needle guideth and maketh way for the thread; ſo doth the act of the faculty of the vnderſtanding, direct the act of the faculty of the <hi>Will.</hi> And we haue vſed ſimilitudes for diuers reaſons. 1. For, they haue great force to convince the iudgement. 2. They allure the affections. 3. They bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the memorie. And 4. They bring many things to ſpeedy remembrance we had long forgot. As the ſhooemaker with his skinne, draweth on a cloſe ſhoe; the huſwife with corne, calleth the chickens from vnder the wings of their damme; and the Dittie brings to minde the matter and author on't: ſo will a ſimilitude draw doctrines into mens ſhallow vnderſtanding, call out the dead affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and bring the truth to remembrance, committed to memorie long agone. And this one thing would I wiſh the man of God to take knowledge of, and to haue reſpect of, both in writing of bookes, and preaching of Sermons, firſt throughly to informe the iudgement, and then ſoundly to ſeeke to reforme the <hi>Will.</hi> Lay loade on that aboue all. For, with more eaſe may a man p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For, the faculty of the <hi>Will,</hi> is the moſt corrupt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Will</hi> is an vnwilling agent to goe to worke.

Furthermore, we haue, as the matter handled would affoord, vſed definitions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, ſubdiuiſions, trialls, motiues and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: all which be of great vſe in their proper order.</p>

            <p>Finally, to our power, we haue endeuoured to comfort the feeble-minded, ſtrengthen the weake, raiſe vp the declined chriſtian, and pull downe the proud minde of man, breake his flinty heart, and convert him to God, by a cloſe ſearching and inſinuating application.</p>
            <p>And Gentle Reader, if any phraſe in this treatiſe, ſeeme tart vnto thee, when we come to preſſe a point; why, I muſt giue thee to vnderſtand, that our people are not like other people. For, it's well knowne, that, in all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring and hauen townes (of which ours is not the leaſt in our kingdome) there is ſuch a concourſe of all kinds of people from other countries, as dayly inhabitants; that we haue men, as of warre and worth, reſolution and religion, fearing God, honouring the king, (the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whereof the good Lord increaſe an hundred times ſo many as they be, that the eares and eyes of all the world may heare and ſee them:) ſo haue we ſinne and ſinners of all ſorts.</p>
            <p>With vs (if any where) thou maiſt finde old mother Ignorance, cloathed with the robes of the blackneſſe of darkneſſe; hauing two vnnaturall (but, to her, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) twinnes in her lappe, <hi>Profaneſſe and Superſtition:</hi> and this is her daily Ditty; <hi>I ſit as a Queene, I am no</hi>

And we haue too, aged father <hi>Pride,</hi> cloathed in Purple, and fine linnen; who being drunke with wealth, as <hi>Lot,</hi> with wine, hath lien with his daughter Couetouſneſſe, committed inceſt, and ſhe is deliuered of a monſter, the which ſome call foxe-fur'd, Scarlet-robde, but I, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, remedileſſe Vſury. This Oſtrich can eat and digeſt any kinde of mettall, eſpecially money. This Canniball,

The greateſt Clerkes (now fie!) in our Kingdome, may, ſeuen times more, ſpit this ſtrumpet in the face, yet ſhe hath a whores forehead, and will not be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meager</hi> and <hi>Pale-face't enuie</hi> hath his <hi>rooſt</hi> with vs. He lookes like a Ghoſt wrapped in a winding ſheete, or peeping out of a coffin: for, with the hot purſuite of ſpotleſſe purity, innocent pietie, he hath ſo fret his fleſh, and worne his ſpirits, that he is fallen into a neuer-to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be-cured deadly conſumption. This inſatiable cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, feedes on the tendereſt corps, drinkes the pureſt blood, and ſtill cryes for more, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or elſe he will dye. And as <hi>riſibilitie</hi> is an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable adiunct to a reaſonable creature: ſo is <hi>damning drunkenneſſe</hi> to theſe Cinque-ports. Therefore, we are ſure of this gueſt. Sometimes, we haue met him ſtaggering in the ſtreetes, with long lockes, red eyes, wounds in his face, and a ſtinking breath flying from his mouth; and his attire, with ſpuing, falling, and tumbling in the mire, polluted from his felt to his foot. Many times he lyes ſpeechleſſe, yet when he ſpeakes, its the very lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Hell.</p>
            <p>This Chymiſt, by a virtuall power and dayly habit, can turne bodies into barrels, men into beaſts; and then, as the Diuels poſſeſſing the ſwine, carried them headlong into the riuer: ſo doth this Deuill ſoule or body wherein he reſteth, into the gulfe of that ſea, whoſe ſtreames are fire and brimſtone. We haue now and then diſorder put in, who lying winde) or rather wine) bound, falles to wooing and wedding. He comes, as Sathan ſaid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

The mutable newfangled <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> who will weare no weapons, haue all things common; yet wrangles with his brethren, whether hee is to be baptized on the head or heeles; for (a worthie reaſon) Chriſt, its ſaid, waſhed his Diſciples with water on the feete.

            <head>AN EXPOSITION OF THE SECOND EPISTLE OF THE APOSTLE S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> PAVL TO TIMOTHIE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Epiſtles of the Apoſtles were directed either to Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in generall, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, Corinthians;</hi> or perſons in particular, as, <hi>Titus, Gaius.</hi> And they were private men, as <hi>Philemon;</hi> or publike, as this <hi>Timotheus,</hi> who was a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Goſpell, and (as ſome maintaine) the firſt elect Biſhop of the Church at <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, for the more Methodicall proceeding in this our intended progreſſe, two things neceſſarily are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, obſerved. 1. The <hi>ſcope</hi> or <hi>end,</hi> which our Apoſtle in penning this Epiſtle aymed at, intended. 2. The <hi>many weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Motiues</hi> or <hi>Arguments,</hi> he produceth to haue his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe accompliſhed, thorowly effected.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:972:17"/>
            <p>True it is that as amongſt various cauſes, there is one prime and firſt efficient, the which is <hi>God;</hi> ſo amids ſeverall ends, one principall and tranſcendent, which is his <hi>glory.</hi> For, as <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> are the initiall and finall letters of the whole <hi>alphabet;</hi> ſo is <hi>God, firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt, beginning and end of every creature.</hi> Taking therefore, as granted, that the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt and chiefeſt marke our Apoſtle eyed, aymed at, was the glory of God, as doubtleſſe it was; the <hi>ſubordinate</hi> ſhall be related, annexed, the which in this Epiſtle are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, included.</p>
            <p>1. He <hi>exhorteth Timothie, to cheriſh, ſtir vp,</hi> and <hi>increaſe the gifts of God in him, and to be ſtrong in the grace, which is in Chriſt Ieſus. 2. To walke vprightly, ſincerely,</hi> and not to diuert from the expreſſe <hi>patterne of ſound words,</hi> which he had received, learned. 3. <hi>To doe the worke of an Evangeliſt, Preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon;</hi> and to be <hi>faithfull,</hi> and <hi>painefull</hi> in the execution of his function. 4. With <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to beare the croſſe, ſuffer affliction,</hi> and <hi>not to be aſhamed of the teſtimony of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> 5. He <hi>foretelleth</hi> him of <hi>perilous times; premoniſheth</hi> him of <hi>evill workers,</hi> in <hi>generall,</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him a caveat, to beware of <hi>Alexander the Copper-ſmith,</hi> who had <hi>withſtood his Preaching much,</hi> in <hi>particular.</hi> 6. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he <hi>deſires</hi> him to <hi>come vnto him,</hi> and <hi>bring Marke,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his <hi>Cloake, Bookes,</hi> and <hi>Parchments</hi> with him. Theſe be the inferiour, and ſecondary ends of <hi>Pauls</hi> penning this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</p>
            <p>The <hi>arguments,</hi> whereby the Apoſtle would induce <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> to diſcharge, and performe the forenamed particulars, are many, ſome whereof ſhall be mentioned. 1. becauſe he was deſcended of faithfull &amp; religious Parents. 2. From the good opinion the Apoſtle conceived of him. 3. In that he was well and rarely qualified. 4. Foraſmuch as his calling was holy, and ſalvation certaine. 5. He would allure him by his owne example, being an Apoſtle, and a man of greater note and dignitie. 6. And alſo from the ſhame, which befell revolters, and the honour, that redounded to <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> who perſevered in well-doing. All theſe are conteined in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:972:17"/> the firſt Chapter: the reſt ſhall be omitted, except, when in this Diſcourſe, ſpeciall occaſion is offered, that they ſhould be produced, rolated.</p>
            <p>In the two <hi>first</hi> Verſes of this Chapter, you haue the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi>

The <hi>ſalutation</hi> is laid downe, as by the <hi>matter of it, what he wiſheth,</hi> ſo by the <hi>perſons, who are to accompliſh it;</hi> and <hi>the one</hi> is <hi>God the Father, the other, Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> Verſe, where <hi>the bodie</hi> of this Epiſtle begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, we haue the <hi>Apoſtles carriage,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> toward <hi>God,</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Timothie.</hi> Concerning <hi>God,</hi> he <hi>acknowledgeth,</hi> that, he did <hi>ſerue him;</hi> for <hi>extent,</hi> from his <hi>elders;</hi> for <hi>manner,</hi> with a <hi>pure Conſcience.</hi> Now for his <hi>behaviour</hi> to <hi>Timothie,</hi> he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,</hi> that, he did <hi>thanke God for</hi> him, and alſo <hi>make mention of</hi> him <hi>in his prayers;</hi> for <hi>conſtancie, without ceaſing;</hi> for <hi>time, night</hi> and <hi>day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle further declareth the <hi>earneſt deſire</hi> he had, <hi>to ſee Timothie,</hi> being induced from the <hi>end,</hi> the <hi>increaſe of his owne ioy,</hi> and by a <hi>twofold motiue</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Timothie,</hi> the one was the <hi>remembrance</hi> of his <hi>teares,</hi> the other from the <hi>vnfeigned faith</hi> he conceived to be in him. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſixt</hi> Verſe, <hi>Paul</hi> puts <hi>Timotheus</hi> in <hi>minde, to ſtirre vp the gift, which was in him,</hi> where he maketh mention of the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> thereof, <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>inſtrumentall,</hi> which was the <hi>impoſition of hands;</hi> vrging him to doe ſo, from a <hi>twofold reaſon;</hi> the <hi>former,</hi> in that he was <hi>freed from the ſpirit of feare;</hi> the <hi>latter,</hi> having <hi>received</hi> the ſpirit of <hi>power, &amp;c.</hi> verſ. 7.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in the <hi>next</hi> Verſe, he <hi>dehorteth</hi> his ſonne, from <hi>being aſhamed,</hi> and that <hi>firſt,</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> of <hi>him, his priſoner. Alſo</hi> he <hi>exhorteth</hi> him <hi>to ſuffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions;</hi> for <hi>kinde,</hi> ſuch as <hi>accompanie the Goſpell;</hi> for <hi>meaſure,</hi> according <hi>to the power he had from God.</hi> Both of which alſo he <hi>preſſeth</hi> from the <hi>forenamed grounds</hi> in ver. 7. <hi>And</hi> likewiſe from the <hi>certaintie</hi> of his <hi>ſaluation,</hi> and the <hi>holineſſe</hi> of his <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:972:18"/> verſ. 9. Of which favours he <hi>remoueth a falſe cauſe,</hi> his <hi>owne workes,</hi> and <hi>ſetteth</hi> downe <hi>the true;</hi> the <hi>fountaine, Gods mercie,</hi> the <hi>conduit</hi> of conveighing it, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus; affirming further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that, it was <hi>purpoſed</hi> and <hi>given</hi> in Chriſt, before the world beganne, but now <hi>manifeſted</hi> by <hi>his bright appearing.</hi> And by the way, he <hi>deſcribeth</hi> our Saviour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from <hi>two notable effects,</hi> viz. the <hi>abolition</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> &amp; the <hi>reduction</hi> of <hi>life; adding</hi> the <hi>meane,</hi> whereby they are applied to vs, and that is, through the <hi>Goſpell.</hi> verſ. 10. Concerning which Goſpell, <hi>Paul teſtifieth two things;</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> that he <hi>was appointed to preach it;</hi> the <hi>other,</hi> and that vnto <hi>the Gentiles;</hi> verſ. 11. Then he proceedeth to <hi>declare, firſt,</hi> his <hi>intertainment</hi> for ſo doing, he ſuffered <hi>afflictions.</hi> 2. His <hi>cariage,</hi> that, he <hi>was not aſhamed.</hi> Where he <hi>annexeth</hi> a <hi>double ground of his reſolution;</hi> the <hi>former</hi> flowing from <hi>an experience of God;</hi> the <hi>latter,</hi> from a <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> he <hi>would keepe that he had committed to him.</hi> verſ. 12.</p>
            <p>In the ſucceeding Verſes, <hi>Paul exhorteth Timothie</hi> to a <hi>two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold dutie, firſt, to hold faſt the forme of ſound words, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of him,</hi> which would direct, and preſerue him as from <hi>errour</hi> in <hi>doctrine,</hi> ſo from <hi>ſinne</hi> in his <hi>converſation;</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi> to <hi>keepe ſafe the good things committed to him; preſcribing</hi> him the <hi>way,</hi> which is by <hi>the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, in him.</hi> verſ. 13. 14.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle having finiſhed the former exhortations, <hi>complaineth he was forſaken,</hi> and that <hi>generally,</hi> of <hi>all Aſia; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,</hi> he nominateth two eminent perſons, <hi>Phygellus,</hi> and <hi>Hermogenes.</hi> For the truth whereof, he <hi>appealeth</hi> to his ſonne <hi>Timothie.</hi> verſ. 15.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>concluſion</hi> of this Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. 17. 18. He <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth</hi> a good man, one <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> whom he <hi>prayeth for,</hi> with his <hi>whole houſhold.</hi> That which he petitioneth for them, is <hi>mercie;</hi> the <hi>time</hi> when, is the <hi>day of iudgement.</hi> The <hi>motiues,</hi> whereby he was induced thus to doe, are taken, from the <hi>kindneſſes Oneſiphorus</hi> had ſhewed him. <hi>At Rome he refreſhed him, not aſhamed of his chaine. And,</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he <hi>alſo</hi> had <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred</hi> vnto him, <hi>many things,</hi> as <hi>Timothy knew very well.</hi> Thus you fee the diſtinct Heads, in this Chapter, vnfolded, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>

                  <hi>typicall</hi> or <hi>reall</hi> Now, this Chriſt is <hi>true, reall,</hi> not <hi>falſe,</hi> not <hi>typicall.</hi> And it may be, he aſſumed both an Hebrew and a Greeke name, cloſely to teach, he was Saviour both of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For, vnder theſe words are his offices compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. He was anointed in reſpect of his Man-hood, not the God-head. For, that is holines it ſelfe, and cannot admit of any ambiene, or created vnction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the will of God</hi>] Here the Apoſtle layeth downe the true <hi>ground of his calling; partly,</hi> to <hi>ſtop</hi> the <hi>mouthes</hi> of his <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping adverſaries: partly,</hi> to <hi>remoue falſe cauſes,</hi> as <hi>Symonie,</hi> and the <hi>like,</hi> and <hi>partly,</hi> that his doctrine might be accompanied with the greater maieſtie, making way for acceptation.</p>
               <p>Here obſerue, that, <hi>Will</hi> is aſcribed to God the <hi>Father,</hi> as<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 20. Prov 8. 22. 1. Cor. 1. 24. Luk. 1. 35.</note>

Thus, diſtinct actions are appropriated to the diſtinct perſons in the Deitie. And the reaſon is, in that, the Father worketh from himſelfe (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving none in order to precede him:) the Sonne from the Father (being in order, after him:) and the holy Ghoſt from both (both being in order before him.) And hence it is, that <hi>Election</hi> is given ſo often in Scriptures, to the <hi>Father,</hi>

                  <hi>Promiſe</hi>] Here the Apoſtle oppoſeth the Goſpell, and the Law, not that the obſervation of the Law, would not haue given life, or was without a promiſe, but, becauſe, that man, ſince his fall, is dead, and cannot keepe it; therefore, he is to fetch life, from another fountaine, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>goſpell,</hi> which is, in briefe, called the <hi>Promiſe of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of life</hi>]. There is a fourefold life, at the leaſt, to be found, in the creatures; 1. a life of <hi>vegetation,</hi> as in herbes, &amp; plants, 2. a life of <hi>ſence,</hi> as in birds and beaſts. 3. of <hi>reaſon,</hi> as in man and Angels. 4. a life of <hi>grace</hi> (called <hi>the life of God.</hi> Eph. 4. 8.) onely to be found in good Angels, and ſuch men, as are <hi>borne againe;</hi> and this is that life, which is here promiſed, by the Apoſtle preached, and principally to be deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which is in Chriſt Ieſus</hi>]. Chriſt is the fountaine of this ſpring, the roote of this tree, and the very firſt beginner of this ſpirituall life, and motion. For, without him, we are dead, can doe nothing.<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 5.</note>

Nature, by a ſecret inſtinct will defend the head, with the loſſe of the hand, and will we not cover our baldneſſe with a Periwigge?

And thus it comes to paſſe.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the precepts of the Law exacts a perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,<note place="margin" type="runSum">

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>received, freely giue:</hi> againe God reſpects the affection of the action, more then the thing given; for a wicked man may doe the one, but not the other; <hi>he loues a cheerefull gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. 2 Cor.</hi> 9. 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The matter or thing rendred muſt bee good: firſt, we may not render evill for evill, much leſſe, evill, for good: ſecondly, againe, iuſtice requires it; and the very law of nature, to doe as we would be done vnto. Who is he that would bee content to receiue evill for good? or what proportion is there betwixt them? are they not the greateſt oppoſites?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The laſt thing in this definition is, that wee muſt render good things for good things; for though we may doe good for evill, yet wee muſt not giue thankes for evill: firſt, for it is naught in it owne nature: ſecondly, and that were follie in vs; and might moue the authour of it, either to ſcoffe at vs, or harden him in a courſe of evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But it may be obiected, that Gods children haue given<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiect.</note> thankes for afflictions, and they are evill.</p>
               <p>True, they haue done ſo; yet not ſimply for afflictions;<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reſol.</note> but firſt, as they bee tokens of Gods loue: for if wee were without corrections, whereof all are partakers, then <hi>were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:972:38"/> we baſtards and not ſonnes: Heb.</hi> 12. 8. Secondly, the Lord will cauſe them to worke for the good of his; and in that they are to thanke him for them: elſe not, <hi>Rom. 8. 28. Pſal.</hi> 119. 21.</p>
               <p>Obſerue further, that good things are either exhibited or promiſed; ſo that we are to prayſe God, for his promiſes, as for performances: firſt, for they are good things: ſecondly, they ſhall all be accompliſhed in a convenient ſeaſon; and this duty haue the Saints alſo practiſed: <hi>Luk: 1. 46. Tim:</hi> 4: 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thankefulneſſe</hi> is either <hi>conceived,</hi> or <hi>manifeſted: conceived</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thankfulnes diſtributed.</note> in will, and reſolution: <hi>manifested</hi> in <hi>word</hi> or <hi>deede.</hi> The firſt kind is hid from man, yet knowne to God, and is the cauſe of the other that followes, and (in ſome ſence) the leaſt degree of thankefulneſſe: for what is in the heart, will (vpon iuſt occaſion) breake forth into ſpeech; yea, (if there be abilitie) into action alſo: as in erecting of ſchooles, hoſpitals; building of churches, colledges; maintaining of miniſters; receiving of the poore, and the like.</p>
               <p>Againe, thankefulneſſe is either ſincere or hypocriticall, what one doth in truth; another may in appearance: as we reade of the Phariſee, who ſtopped into the Temple with a Lord, I thanke thee: &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11.</p>
               <p>This checkes the current of our times, which is alwaies<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> craving; but never reſtoring: many pray, yet doe not pay; For what are thankes, but pence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God ſels his favour for? we haue not onely nine, but nintie times nine, who never<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 17.</note> returne praiſe for their cleanſing: many, (and its good) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat others to pray for them; yet, (which were better) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find time, to deſire men to giue thankes for them.</p>
               <p>How many favours haue we received? how many preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes are vnto vs exhibited, whereof wee take no knowledge? Is not this the ſigne of an vngratefull minde? I had almoſt ſaid, of a graceleſſe heart?</p>
               <p>But to leaue ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let vs ſtudie, and practiſe this dutie;<note place="margin" type="runSum">

                  <hi>for all his benefits?</hi> He would call vpon all creatures to praiſe him in their kinde. No ſurer ſigne of ſound grace than to be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:972:38"/> frequent in this action: doubtleſſe, a gratefull heart hath ſet times to praiſe God, as to pray vnto him; they thinke no houres better ſpent, than in thus doing: O, how will ſuch reioyce, when they finde their hearts enlarged, and their lips opened to prayſe God? Such a day to them, is of more worth than a thouſand others: but becauſe to doe this, is no eaſie matter; remoue we the impediments, that hinder; vſe the helpes that further this action; and they be ſuch as theſe following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When as we thinke, that <hi>our owne handes haue procured</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Impediments of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>vs our abundance. Is not this Babell, which I built, by the might of my power? When as except the Lord build the houſe, man la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in vaine:</hi> When men doe not know, that all comes from God, they will ſacrifice to <hi>their owne nets.</hi> Deut. 8. 17. Dan. 4. 30. <hi>Pſal. 127. 1. Hab.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond is, vnmindfulneſſe of Gods mercies: he that forgetteth a kindneſſe done, it is all one for the preſent, as if he never received any: whence ſprings theſe ſpeeches; true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I had thanked you, but it was out of my minde; I had quite forgot; I pray you pardon me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third, is diſcontent; when this rules in the heart, no thankes is to be had; a contented minde, is alwayes a thankfull minde. Whence it commeth to paſſe, that proud men, covetous men, or ambitious men are vngratefull men. The bird will not prune &amp; ſing, till ſhe haue tooke a ſtand, that giues her full content. When wee can ſay with <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 33. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>We haue all things;</hi> then we will giue thankes for all things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And not to mention any more, ignorance of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, (were we deprived of preſent favours) is a great blocke in the way: what were a man, if he were ſtript of his clothes? and turned without food, but a day or two into the fields? Should we but lodge one night in Egypt, England would be a good Countrey: were we in ſuch a famine, as was in <hi>Samaria,</hi> that the Mother muſt famiſh, or eat the fruit of her<note place="margin">2 King. 6. 28.</note> owne wombe; then food would be worth thankeſgiving. But we haue loſt our taſt, (and thats the reaſon we cry, giue me my will as <hi>Rachell</hi> did ſonnes, or elſe we die?) being ſtill<note place="margin">Gen. 30. 1.</note>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:972:39"/> petitioning, never repaying. We are like the earth, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues many bodies; but without a miracle wrought, will not yeeld vp one: ſo muſt God pull thankes by violence out of our hearts, <hi>if he will haue any.</hi> Helpes to true thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

               <p>Secondly, take knowledge of the Lords dealing with thee,<note place="margin" type="runSum">2.</note> in giving thee a <hi>being of nothing;</hi> and that in a comely maner: are all creatures men and women?

               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thinke of thy preſent condition;</hi> haſt thou food<note place="margin" type="runSum">4.</note> and rayment in abundance?

And are theſe common favours? Waſt thou ever wounded in ſpirit? Then who healed, and helped thee? Did ſin ever preſſe thee to the pit of hell? How, or by what meanes waſt thou eaſed?

               <p>And, we muſt be able to vnderſtand the ſubſiſtences; which are nothing elſe, but, <hi>that one moſt pure eſſence, with his relatiue properties.</hi> The ſubſiſtences are <hi>the Father,</hi> and <hi>the Sonne,</hi> and <hi>the holy Ghoſt.</hi> The relatiue propertie of the Father is to <hi>beget;</hi> therefore he is the firſt in order. The Sonnes relatiue propertie is, to be <hi>begotten,</hi> and not to beget; and he is the ſecond perſon in order, becauſe he is from the Father alone. The <hi>holy Ghoſt is the perſon proceeding from the Father and the Sonne;</hi> and therefore the third perſon in order; ſo that we muſt vnderſtand, that God is one eſſence in three perſons: thus much for his ſufficiencie.</p>
               <p>And, for his <hi>efficiencie,</hi> what is that? But, <hi>that whereby he

               <p>The ſecond thing that we ought to know, is, <hi>What the Lord requireth of vs;</hi> for how can wee doe it, if wee doe not know it? Or ſuppoſe, wee ſhould doe what he willes, yet what comfort can we haue in this ſervice, or action? If a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhall plow, ſow, and harrow a plot of ground, without his Maſters will and direction; what content could he haue in working? What hope of reward, after he had finiſhed his labour? Would not feare rather poſſeſſe him, ſeeing the ground might haue beene as profitable for paſture? When we know our Maſters will, we may with boldnes &amp; chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe goe about it.</p>
               <p>And this his will is conteined in the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What the <hi>Law</hi> requireth.</note> and is there to be found out with ſearching. <hi>The Law</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires <hi>two things:</hi> 1.

And laſtly, that we <hi>liue without ſpot, and blameleſſe,</hi> keeping our hearts vpright with God; our outward actions honeſt before, and with man; for, the Goſpell wils no leſſe inward or outward holineſſe, than the Law doth.

                  <hi>came to eſtabliſh the Law;</hi> that is, to aſſure vs it is ſtill of force, and to giue vs abilitie another way to keepe it.</p>
               <p>Againe, as we haue heard, that we muſt haue knowledge of God and his will, before we can ſerue him; ſo in the next place, we muſt haue <hi>abilitie,</hi> or we cannot doe his will. A ſicke or weake man may know his Maſters pleaſure, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it; for ſtrength with health muſt enable him. So, we know many things, but what of that, if we want power to performe them? And we muſt get power: 1. <hi>To beleeue:</hi>

               <p>Againe, We are to know, that faith is exerciſed about <hi>a double Obiect, God and his Word:</hi> And in his Word; <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> and <hi>the threate.</hi> We are to giue credit, that all the threats of God are true, and ſhall be accompliſhed in vs in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, if wee breake the condition; as well as beleeue all the promiſes, &amp; appropriate them to our ſelues, who are made in Chriſt Ieſus. And in both theſe the beſt man failes for want of abilitie to beleeue them. Our faith may be ſaid to be a kind of obedience, not in getting, but principally in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by it. And as <hi>Iudgement</hi> is vſed in <hi>Invention,</hi> being a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct part of the Art of <hi>Logick;</hi> yet Invention doth precede Iudgement in nature: ſo obedience is vſed in faith; and faith in obedience, though faith may ſeeme to goe before it; for, <hi>He that comes to God, muſt beleeue that he is; and</hi> (then) <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that diligently ſeeke him:</hi> Heb. 11. 16. So that by <hi>power to beleeue</hi> (I meane) <hi>that God is, that his Word is truth,</hi> both <hi>in the threatnings and promiſes;</hi> and ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed accordingly, as we keepe the <hi>conditions.</hi> And by <hi>obedience,</hi> I doe vnderſtand, <hi>a conſcionable care to beleeue threat</hi> and <hi>promiſe,</hi> aſwell as to <hi>obey the precept;</hi> for, to beleeue is to obey; and <hi>to liue by faith may be called the obedience of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 8.</p>
               <p>Many haue ſome care in ſomethings to obey the Precept, but never regard to liue by <hi>faith:</hi> and if they can ſay, they beleeue in Chriſt Ieſus, then, they thinke, all is ſure, and their dutie diſcharged; as though a man muſt never vſe his hand, but in holding fruit in it, and not in applying it to the mouth: aſſuredly, faith hath a worke in every action, that we performe; and that not onely in aſſuring vs the thing is lawfull we doe; but in perſwading the Lord will performe his promiſe to vs, when wee haue kept the covenant with him.</p>
               <p>And vnderſtand this, that if we could beleeue more, wee ſhould obey more; for all life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> motion, and ſpirituall action comes from faith; as all naturall acts are ſaid to proceede from the forme.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now, becauſe a good Conſcience is little knowne, leſſe regarded, we will firſt declare what it is in generall; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe the kindes of it; thirdly, ſhew its office or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable companions; and finally make application: yet, by the way, we will deduce ſome <hi>Corrolaries,</hi> the which may ſeeme to flow from the fountaine of each diſtinct defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſcience is a ſeeing of an act with the Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this definition are two things: firſt, the <hi>genus</hi> of it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conſcience</hi> defined.</note> which I call a <hi>ſeeing:</hi> ſecondly, the <hi>forme,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>of an act with the rule.</hi> Neither let any quarrell with the word <hi>ſeeing:</hi> 1. For what is the eye without the act of the ſoule, but a dead inſenſible organt? 2. Grant it to be a Metaphor, or Tropicall ſpeech; yet is not <hi>Rhetorick</hi> a generall Art, and may be every where?</p>
               <p>And it is a ſeeing <hi>of an act with the rule:</hi> For as conſcience is a ſeeing, ſo is it a ſeeing of a double Obiect at one inſtant time. The very <hi>Etymologie</hi> of the word both <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> ſignifies ſo much. Here note, that there muſt be firſt <hi>ſcience</hi> of a rule, ſecondly of an act done; the which two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied, and the eye of the vnderſtanding beholding them together make vp the full forme of Conſcience: for if either of theſe be wanting or ſeparated, it cannot proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called Conſcience. For ſcience is of one ſimple obiect, Conſcience of two laid together, and then with one act of the intellect apprehended ioyntly; whence (likely) it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows the name <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is as much as a ioynt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or ſeeing together of the rule and the act. And from this definition it will follow.</p>
               <p>That Conſcience is not (as ſome hold) a facultie of the<note place="margin">I. <hi>Corrolaries</hi> deduced.</note> ſoule, but rather (as the Schoole-men defend) <hi>an act of the vnderſtandings facultie:</hi> the which may be further confirmed by theſe reaſons. 1. Every facultie is created; Conſcience is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:972:46"/> not created, therefore no facultie. Were it created, then ſhould <hi>Adam</hi> haue a good or bad conſcience before he had done either good or evill, which may not be admitted. True it is, that <hi>Adam</hi> was indued with <hi>ſcience;</hi> ſo that if he had applied the frame of his perſon, to the rule by which he was firſt formed, in that it may be ſaid, he had a good <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:</hi> for there was an equall proportion betwixt them: but vntill he had performed ſome act, it cannot be affirmed of him, that he had any conſcience at all: yet ſcience he had; for, he clearely vnderſtood the Rule, being written in his heart at the Creation, by which his actions were to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. 2. No facultie doth quit or condemne; Conſcience doth qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or condemne, therefore no facultie. Wee never read that God doth accuſe or excuſe a man or Angel for the meere having of a facultie; but for the abuſing or well-v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it. If by facultie they vnderſtand (by a <hi>Metonimie</hi>) the cauſe for the effect (as it ſeemes to me they doe,) then we are all of one and the ſame mind.</p>
               <p>Alſo, we gather this ſecond conſequence, that vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable<note place="margin">II.</note> creatures, as birds and beaſts, fowles and fiſhes, haue no conſcience; becauſe they haue no rule given of God to guide their actions; neither (if they had) any act of reaſon to apprehend it; although a kind of knowledge may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to them.</p>
               <p>And here we may learne, that taking conſcience in a large<note place="margin">III.</note> acception, it may be found in any Art, as well as in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for each Art hath its Precepts, and may haue his <hi>Praxis;</hi> Whence it will follow, that as there is ſcience, ſo alſo there may be conſcience. When a Boy writeth after a Coppie, and taketh a view of his worke, how it anſwers the patterne, this is a kind of conſcience.</p>
               <p>Finally, we conclude hence, that in <hi>luſorie Lots,</hi> there can<note place="margin">IIII.</note> be no conſcience; and the reaſon is, becauſe there is no rule to guide the act; now, no ſcience of the rule, no conſcience. This ſhould teach men to vſe them vpon extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, or not at all; and then the example of the godly may be their warrant. For, how can a man iuſtifie an act,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:972:46"/> that hath not a rule to guide it? or how can there be conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, where ſcience precedes not? For, Simples in order precede Compounds, as is obvious in <hi>Logicke,</hi> the act of reaſon, as alſo in the worke of Creation.</p>
               <p>Hitherto, wee haue ſpoken of Conſcience in generall, which is nothing elſe but a <hi>ſeeing together,</hi> or more plainly a ſeeing <hi>of the act with the rule;</hi> and thus wee proceed to its diſtribution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſcience is good or evill.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conſcience</hi> diſtributed.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As the definitions, ſo the diſtributions of Conſcience are many; yet may they all be reduced to theſe two heades. For as every <hi>Ax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>me</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> is true or falſe: ſo is each mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience good or evill. Some ſay, there is a Conſcience <hi>good,</hi> but <hi>not quiet; quiet,</hi> but <hi>not good; good and quiet;</hi> and <hi>neither good nor quiet:</hi> Yet all theſe are but two and no more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. For reſt and trouble are not eſſentiall, but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall vnto Conſcience. A bad Conſcience, as wee ſee in <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> may now be troubled, anon quieted: and this fals out from varying the Obiect of the intellect, or want of the act and rules application; and ſo may a good Conſcience be attended with the ſame companions, as in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> And this may ariſe from the late commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome ſinne, the weakneſſe of faith, a iealous ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which men haue of their ſpirituall eſtate, or the Lords withdrawing for a time his comfortable aſpect and preſence from his children; and yet this Conſcience is but one and the ſame. Note further, that a wicked man may haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a true rule, and act according therevnto; ſo that the apprehenſion of his well-doing may breed peace. But when he caſteth his eye vpon his many ſwervings from Gods Precepts (except his Conſcience be ſeared through the Lords iuſt iudgement, and his habituall faylings) he cannot be at reſt. In like ſort, the beſt perſon in many things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ranſgreſſeth the Law of his God, in ſo much that when hee conſidereth his many errors, he is greatly diſquieted; ſo that to ſpeake truely, and properly, trouble is an effect of an ill Conſcience peace of a good one; and theſe contrary effects
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:972:47"/> though to be found in one and the ſame perſon; yet doe they ſpring from divers repugnant principles, and not from the ſelfe ſame cauſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A good Conſcience is a ſeeing of an act according with the</hi>

                  <hi>rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here, we are to obſerue, that in a good Conſcience theſe particulars are required: 1. A man muſt haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſome rule: 2. The rule muſt be ſound, and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: 3. He is to performe an act in every reſpect anſwerable to the truth of the rule: And 4. he muſt apply the act to the rule, the which being done, the ſeeing of their agreement is a good Conſcience. <hi>Moſes</hi> made all things according to the patterne, the which when he beheld, he had a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; for there was a proportion and correſpondency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the frame of his worke, and the patterne GOD gaue him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An evill Conſcience is a ſeeing of an act diſaccording with the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe a man to haue vnderſtanding of a true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule; yet if his act ſhould not be anſwerable, but in ſome part divert from it, ſo farre as it wants proportion or ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the foreſaid rule, ſo farre he hath a bad Conſcience, or evill ſeeing together; and hence will follow the kindes or degrees of an evill Conſcience. 1. For, the more ſound knowledge, and the leſſe ſincere obedience, the worſe is that Conſcience; and from hence might ſpring the name of an erroneous Conſcience; becauſe the actions ſwerue from the rule. 2. From obedience, without a certaine apprehenſion of ſome precedent Precept, ariſeth the terme of a blind Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, though properly it cannot be called Conſcience. 3. And from this definition, we ſee that there may be ſome good in a bad Conſcience. For knowledge of the rule is good; acts are good; but as they erre from the rule by which they are to be guided, they are evill; and in regard ſuch Conſciences haue a threat denounced againſt them. Yea the ſight of ſweruing from the rule may be good; becauſe it may be a meanes of reformation in future ſeaſon.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſo, how can they procure a Legall good Conſcience? For, whatſoever action is not guided by a rule, is evill before God: and haue you not heard, that knowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſt precede obedience? and is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for the obtaining of a good Conſcience?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That not any ſince the fall of Man (Chriſt excepted) ever had a complete Legall good Conſcience. For, the beſt <hi>know but in part,</hi> and their obedience (for the moſt) comes<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9.</note> ſhort of their knowledge. Chriſt (indeed) vnderſtood the whole will of his Father, <hi>fulfilled all righteouſneſſe:</hi> no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 15.</note> was in him, nor any ſin ever proceeded from him: ſo that he, and none but he (except we ſhould include the bleſſed Angels) ever had a complete Legall good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for his perſon and actions in every reſpect were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable and correſpondent to the whole Law; he failed not in the leaſt tittle.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence we may cleare the Lord from all iniuſtice, in the condemnation of ſo many millions of men and women: for, doe they know his will? Perfectly obey it? Haue they never erred in iudgement? or gone aſtray in their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If they haue done both, may he not then in his iuſtice condemne them? If any want this forenamed Conſcience, the Lord may in his iuſt iudgement inflict eternall torment vpon them. For, haue they not loſt his Image? Runne they not daily on his skore? Let vs then rather admire his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, than quarrell with his iuſtice, that we all were not long agone conſumed.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:972:50"/>
               <p>4. Finally, we conclude hence, that the ſafeſt and ſecureſt way for vs, is to denie our Legall good conſciences, &amp; ſtriue to obtaine the <hi>Evangelicall,</hi> that we may be iuſtified, ſaved. This is the true and onely way, neither haue wee a better. For though the law be of power to giue life; yet we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, weake, and not able to fulfill it; if we were, then Chriſt dyed in vaine Now, what an Evangelicall good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is; we will paint forth, what concurres to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp of it; wherein it differs from the Legall; what muſt be done to procure it; and how an Evangelicall and Legall are not to be ſeparated in a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>1. For the firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An Evangelicall good Conſcience is a ſeeing of an act according</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, what it is.</note> 
                  <hi>with the rule of the Goſpell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better vnderſtanding of this, know, O ye ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> that God, when he had created man, gaue him a Law written in his heart, the which had he perfectly obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he ſhould haue ſtood for ever. But he falling from the rule of gubernation, fell alſo from conſervation, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, (with all his poſteritie) hable to death; neither is there any abilitie remaining in him to recouer his former condition. For, knowledge is obliterated, the will weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at the leaſt peruerted, and each wheele of ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die exorbitated, turned out of his way: onely, ſo much light he hath left him (like one of <hi>Iobs</hi> meſſengers,) as to tell him, that his Joſſe is great, and condition miſerable. But, marke the mercie of God, who hath given ſpoiled man another rule, whereby he might purchaſe a good Conſcience, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure as great an eſtate, and much better; and that is the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>2. In the ſecond place:</p>
               <p>To the making vp of an Evangelicall good Conſcience, theſe particulars are neceſſary. 1. <hi>Knowledge of the Goſpell;</hi> elſe why ſhould <hi>Paul</hi> ſo highly prize it? So much covet it? And doth not our Saviour Chriſt, place eternall life in the<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 3.</note> having of it? 2. <hi>Obedience</hi> is neceſſary alſo; for, the Goſpell requires <hi>that,</hi> as well as the Law: theſe two may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:972:50"/> ſo that thus farre, a Legall and an Evangelicall good Conſcience accord for, whatſoever is in the <hi>genus,</hi> is in the <hi>ſpecies;</hi> though, the <hi>ſpecies</hi> may include more in it, than is to be found in the <hi>genus.</hi> Grant we that <hi>animal</hi> is the <hi>genus</hi> of man and beaſt; yet, man hath more in him than <hi>animal</hi> hath, to wit, reaſon: notwithſtanding <hi>animal</hi> communicates his whole nature to both the <hi>ſpecies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. In the third place, let vs ſee the differences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is in the ground of obedience; for that in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> before his apoſtaſie, proceeded from the image of God, wherein he was created; but in vs vnder the Goſpell, it ſprings from faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that theſe two differ is evident; but how, is not eaſily diſcerned; and who did ever affirme that they were one and the ſame? For, doth not the former come by Creation, the latter by Regeneration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a reall difference in regard of the act; for, the Law runnes on this wiſe, <hi>Doe and liue:</hi> the Goſpell thus, <hi>Beleeue and liue.</hi> And though to beleeue in the Goſpell, be a kinde of obedience, becauſe God ſo commandes; yet the holy Ghoſt in the Scripture makes a diſtinction betwixt them. And doubtleſſe the head Chriſt, obeyed the Law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another manner, than we his members doe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third difference is the Obiect, about which the act is converſant; for, the Law giueth particular Precepts how to direct all our actions. The Goſpell is as a ſtaffe, or ſtay, whereon the act reſteth and cleaueth vnto. Hence is this phraſe ſo frequent in the Goſpell, <hi>Beleeue in me:</hi> and<note place="margin">Ioh. 9. 35. Act. 16. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>they that beleeue in,</hi> or <hi>on the ſonne of God, &amp;c.</hi> So that the Law giues rules for the acts direction; the Goſpell for its ſupportation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, a complete Legall good Conſcience requires many acts to the perfecting of it: for, if one commanded be omitted, or the contrary committed, Conſcience is ſpoyled, ſhipwrackt. Now, an Evangelicall requires but one onely to the making of it complete. For, one act of beleeuing will vnite to Chriſt; by which vnion, man is made partaker of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:972:51"/> the all-ſufficient obedience of Chriſt, which is the ſole and abſolute obiect matter of an Evangelical good conſcience. For, as one act of <hi>Adam</hi> brake the whole decalogue; ſo one act of faith in Chriſt will perfectly fulfill it. Where note, that the habit of faith, neither its act without its obiect, makes an Evangelicall good conſcience, and conſequently iuſtifies not. For the whole obedience of Chriſt is it, that ſatisfies the iuſtice of the law; the which, when we by faith are conioyned to him, is made all ours; and ſo are we quit from the rigor of the law, by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt our furetie, and that by one onely act of faith in him, which is the condition on our parts to be performed, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of an Evangelicall good conſcience. Was not the <hi>braſen ſerpent</hi> a prototype of Chriſt? and would it cure any, without the act of the eye fixed on it? Alſo, would not one act of looking on it, heale him that was ſtung with many ſerpents, in that wildernes? ſo the act of faith ſeparated from Chriſt cures none, and one act of credence in him, as he is our ſurety, will, (though our ſinnes be great and many,) make vs ſound, perfect, and helpe vs againſt all, our mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>4. In the fourth place, for the procuring of an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall conſcience, wee muſt haue,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and that, both of the Law and Goſpell. For, he that vnderſtands not the Lawes precepts, and what it requireth, can neither ſee his ſinne, or be conſtrained to runne vnto the Goſpell for reliefe in the time of neede. And though our Father <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall; had hee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the rules of the law, might haue procured a, legall good conſcience, without any vnderſtanding of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; yet it is otherwiſe with vs. For, we muſt ſee our debt, before wee can haue a mind either by our ſelues or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to diſcharge it; and without knowledge of the law this will not be effected. And the Goſpell muſt alſo be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of vs. For, it is the new couenant, the law of libertie to ſet vs free, who are in ſpirituall bondage. And as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the law was neceſſarie for <hi>Adam,</hi> that hee might
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:972:51"/> obey and liue: ſo is it of the Goſpell, that we might beleeue and liue. Obſerue here, that a more exact knowledge, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the three perſons in the Godhead; of their relatiue properties, and peculiar operations is required of vs, ſince the fall than before it. For, though we dare not denie to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the certaine vnderſtanding of the Trinitie, yet, in the perfect knowledge of God ſimplie conſidered, and of his will, in the obedience whereof, he might haue obtained a legall good conſcience. But, now we are to goe a ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our reſtauration: becauſe, man being fallen, wee are to conceiue, how God the father is primarily offended, how the Sonne aſſumed our nature to make an atonement for vs to him; and how the holy Ghoſt doth apply the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption purchaſed by Chriſt Ieſus. For in theſe and the like particulars conſiſteth the whole ſubiect of the Goſpell; and therefore of abſolute neceſſitie, in ſome degree to bee vnderſtood, and learned of vs. For, <hi>this is eternall life to know God, and whom he hath ſent Ieſus Chriſt; and no man can ſay</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 17. 3. 1 Cor. 12. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>that Chriſt is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond ingredient for the completion of an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall good conſcience, is <hi>faith;</hi> not that poore depraved faith, which may be found in apoſtata men and devils, who are ſayd to <hi>beleeue and tremble,</hi> but that which <hi>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ifieth, iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 2. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>purifieth, conquereth and ſaveth.</hi> For, the holy image of God wherein man at the firſt was created, is not more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the acquiring of a legall good conſcience, then this faith we ſpeake of, is neceſſarie for the accompliſhing of an Evangelicall. For what will it profit a man to haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the law and Goſpell? to be indued with ſuch and ſo much faith, as to giue credit to the truth of the precepts, promiſes, threats, and to want that perſonall, peculiar, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per faith, whereby Chriſt is applied in particular with all his benefits? ſo that without this ſpirit of faith, an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall good conſcience cannot be made complete. And here you may cleerly behold, that there is a diſtinct kind of faith, as there is of knowledge, but the firſt without the ſecond auailes nothing to our purpoſe. For, of certaine, <hi>Adam</hi> had
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:972:52"/> a faith, which did inable him to beleeue the truth of the Law, as alſo the accompliſhment of the promiſes &amp; threats vpon the obſervation, or breach of the ſame: But how theſe two differ, to diſcerne is ſome difficultie. The <hi>Romanists</hi> affirme, that there is but one kind of faith in men and devils: and the reaſon why ſome are ſaued, others periſh, is becauſe the one haue charitie, the other not: But here they get it miſt. For, this faith we haue in hand is of another kinde, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Goſpell to worke it, and Chriſt Ieſus the chiefe obiect of it. Some may then ſay, that a good Chriſtian hath a double faith. True, yet the former not accompanied with the latter, is not ſufficient. It may further be demanded, what then becomes of the firſt, when the ſecond is wrought in vs? Anſw: What if we ſay, it remaines? Doth that hinder vs? May not both ſtand together? For, as the knowledge of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſhoulders not out the former knowledge of the Law; ſo doth not this new faith the old, as I may ſtile it: Graunt it ſhould; yet, of it ſelfe, it hath force to doe what the other can, and more too. Inſomuch, that if we ſhould maintaine, that as purer ſpirits are renewed in the naturall bodie, the more groſſe are purged out: ſo, as this latter is increaſed, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is decreaſed; there could be no danger.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, we come to demonſtrate, how that a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and an Evangelicall good Conſcience are not to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in him that ſhall be ſaved. For, he who hath the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath the former. But obſerue this, that a Legall good Conſcience is either perſonall or imputatiue; and both theſe accompany every member of Chriſt Ieſus. For, Chriſts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Law is wholly imputed to every true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; ſo that, he hath a Legall imputatiue Conſcience. When <hi>Adam,</hi> of whom we were members, brake the rule of the Law, his diſobedience being imputed to vs, we had a Legall bad Conſcience: ſo, Chriſts obedience, wee being made <hi>bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh,</hi> being alſo imputed to vs,<note place="margin">Epheſ, 5. 30.</note> we may a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> truely be ſaid to haue a Legall good Conſcience. Whence, obſerue by the way, theſe two Concluſions: Firſt, that, It is the righteouſneſſe of the Law which is the obiect
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:972:52"/> matter of an Evangelicall good Conſcience. Thus I proue it. The obedience of Chriſt is the obiect matter of an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall good Conſcience; the obedience of Chriſt is the righteouſneſſe of the Law; therefore, the righteouſneſſe of the Law is the obiect matter of an Evangelicall good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The ſecond Concluſion is, That every Beleever is as truely righteous as Chriſt Ieſus. The reaſon is, in that his obedience is our obedience, being by faith applyed. So that in this ſence; we are able to anſwer the ſtrict and full iuſtice of the Law. But this we doe further affirme, that he who hath an Evangelicall good Conſcience, hath alſo a perſonall Legall good Conſcience, though not perfect and complete. For, the Scripture ordinarily coupleth them together. See <hi>Pſal. 32. 2. 1. Cor. 6. 11. Rom.</hi> 8. 1. And there be Reaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:972:53"/> the Father; every act ſhall be proportionable to its rule; and is not that to keepe a good Conſcience? This may ſerue to ſtop the mouths of our barking adverſaries, who cry out, that we Preach a doctrine of libertie, how men may be ſaved without good workes, when as the contrary is it we defend and practiſe. For, faith in Chriſt is never ſevered from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Law, no more than leuitie and grauitie from aire and water. And thus we make a Progreſſe to ſpeake of the office or effects of Conſcience, according to our former Method propounded.</p>
               <p>1. There is amongſt Divines a great ſtirre of the effects<note place="margin">The atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. 1. How it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth.</note> of Conſcience; but may I herein ſhew mine opinion, it is thus. Conſcience, I confeſſe, is a cauſe of accuſation, and excuſation; but how? Not of it ſelfe alone, as a ſolitary cauſe, but by reaſon of a kind of beleefe which doth attend it. Firſt I am reſolved by ſome internall principle, that I ſhould doe iuſtice; Next, I haue a rule giuen me to direct me therein. Thirdly, obſerue that this rule hath a double concomitant; 1. <hi>A promiſe of reward,</hi> if I obey it. 2. <hi>A threat of revenge,</hi> if I tranſgreſſe it: All this I know and beleeue. Now, when I would caſt vp my ſpirituall account, and ſee my preſent condition, then, reſolues <hi>Will,</hi> the beginner of this worke, to try it on this manner.</p>
               <p>She ſtirres vp the memory, and cals to mind all the good and evill, ſhe hath omitted or committed; then ſhe applieth all theſe acts of omiſſion and commiſſion, to the rule fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named and remembred; and having done ſo, the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding takes a ſtrict and exact view of their agreement or diſagreement. Now, if there be a iuſt proportion betwixt the acts and the rule, then there is excuſation, the effect of a good Conſcience. For, Faith reſteth on the promiſe, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the Law-giuer. But if there be a diſagreement, then followeth accuſation, the attendant of a bad Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For, beleefe giues credit to the threat, and expects a penaltie. And thus you ſee how a good Conſcience excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, a bad accuſeth, by reaſon of faith being interpoſed. Neither need we to doubt, but the Gentile, had a kinde of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:972:53"/> faith, the which produced theſe effects. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
               <p>The King of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> giues a iuſt law, for the well gouerning of his ſubiects, promiſing a reward to them that obſerue it, threatning a penaltie to them that tranſgreſſe it. I my ſelfe, being one of the number, heare, vnderſtand, and beleeue it. Well; a day is appointed when my obedience muſt be tryed. The Law is read, and I giue eare vnto it. If now my actions anſwer the Kings command, I am not afraid; my Conſcience doth excuſe me? Why? For, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue he will iudge me according to my workes. But if they diſagree from his Precept, then I feare, and my Conſcience doth accuſe me, becauſe I giue credit that anſwerable to the threat, I muſt be rewarded. But, ſuppoſe I were ignorant of my Princes pleaſure; or knowing it, did not yet credit it, ſhould I then haue excuſation or accuſation? Not: and the reaſon is, in that I want faith to beleeue the promiſe or threat, which are of force to accuſe or excuſe being credited. Let vs apply it. God the King of all the world, hath giuen man a Law (writ without him, or within him, that skils not) to gouerne his actions; he alſo hath paſſed his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Word, that the obſervers of it ſhall liue, the tranſgreſſors dye: All this I giue credit to. Now, when I apply mine actions to the Law, and they are proportionable to it, then my Conſcience excuſeth me; for, here is a good ſeeing together. Notwithſtanding all this, Faith muſt credit the promiſe, and threat, for producing of theſe effects; and is in truth the firſt and remote cauſe, though Conſcience be the ſecond and nearer, of accuſation and excuſation. When the hand doth amiſſe, we vſe to ſay, can yee not ſee? Yet it is not the eyes fault: And ſo in this we doe the like, appropriating that vnto Conſcience, the which properly and immediatly ſprings from faith. And tell me, why doth the Devill tremble? Is it not from faith? Why are the profane fearefull? Is it not from faith? Why is a good Chriſtian chearfull? Why? He hath kept the patterne, and hath faith: and why doe we ſometimes doubt, ſometimes beleeue? But from partiall obedience, and an imperfect faith? Yet as wee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:972:54"/> haue ſaid; Conſcience doth accuſe and excuſe, cauſe ioy and feare, as the Precepts of Grammar the boyes Latine; but not without faith. And I pray you, would a Scholler care at all, whether his Latine anſwered the rule or no, had he not faith to beleeue the truth of it and his Maſters promiſe &amp; threat? And thus you ſee our opinion, let the learned iudge.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond effect accompanying a good Conſcience, is <hi>Ioy:</hi> ioy, I ſay, <hi>vnſpeakeable,</hi> vnvtterable. <hi>Davids</hi> Harpe was nothing to this; yet made full pleaſant Muſicke. A good Conſcience will make the heart to leape, <hi>the face to ſhine,</hi> fill the breaſts with milke, and the bones with Marrow. Its<note place="margin">Prov. 15. 15. Iudg. 9. 13.</note> a great, <hi>a continuall feaſt;</hi> Irke <hi>Wine, it cheareth the ſpirit of God and man.</hi> Let <hi>Saul</hi> want it; his kingdome will augment his feare. <hi>Naball</hi> may <hi>make a feaſt like a King; Belſhazzar carowſe in Bowles;</hi> but having not this diſh; their thoughts will trouble them, and their hearts, in the middeſt of all their mirth, dye within them. This, this, is the ground of all true and ſolide ioy; the beſt muſicke will it make, that ever was heard. What cauſed <hi>Iob</hi> to laugh at death? <hi>Peter</hi> to ſing in priſon? <hi>Paul</hi> to comfort himſelfe in the angry Adriaticke Sea? And <hi>Stevens</hi> face to ſhine like an Angell, when the ſtones came flying about his eares? Any thing but a good Conſcience? The gallants of theſe daies may ſeeme the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merry men; but without this, they are all baſe, wretched, miſerable.</p>
               <p>3. Shall we thinke, that Conſcience goeth alone? or with one ſingle attendant or two? as <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Padan-Aram; Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> with his Armor-bearer, or <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to view the walls of <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> No, no, Ioy is on its right hand, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation runnes with it. Caſt a world into the heart of man, he is not ſatisfied, when as <hi>Paul</hi> not having a penny ſhall reſt contented. If thou canſt but ſee the face of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the cloſet of thy ſoule, engrauen on the Tables of thine heart, thou maiſt cry with old <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he ſaw <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his ſonne aliue, <hi>I haue inough;</hi> or with <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> when the King returned ſafe, let the <hi>Zibaes</hi> of the world take all. For, Conſcience is a rich Treaſure, a Cabinet full
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:972:54"/> of precious Pearles, a coſtly banquet. I ſay, that Bread nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, Drinke refreſheth, but a good Conſcience is all in all.</p>
               <p>4. Doth not Conſcience alſo walke with <hi>Hope?</hi> and giue good evidence for time to come? Its like a rich Merchant, who keepeth Factors in a farre Countrey, and forreigne Land: Doth it not ſend hope to trade and barter in the <hi>India</hi> of heaven, from whence ſhe returnes with comfortable ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and ſupporteth Conſcience, vntill all things be had in perfect viſion? Were it not for this, the heart would burſt, and good mens ſpirits faile them for feare. Hope will ſtill be whiſpering Conſcience in the eare, bid it be of good comfort, and not faint; for, <hi>the time of its viſitation is at hand.</hi> Truely, a Conſcienceleſſe man is a hopeleſſe man, and he that wanteth that, ſhall periſh.</p>
               <p>5. Alſo, Conſcience is alwayes armed and attended with <hi>courage, boldneſſe.</hi> And is not that worthy the right hand of fellowſhip? A man of Conſcience dares ſtand before <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> plead his owne cauſe, and force <hi>Faelix</hi> a bribing Iudge to <hi>tremble.</hi> What made the Prophet to giue King <hi>Ahab</hi> the lie? The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to call <hi>the high Prieſt, painted wall?</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> to tell <hi>Herod,</hi> he was an <hi>Adulterer?</hi> But the force that floweth from a good Conſcience? He that hath a good Conſcience, may quench the <hi>fiery darts of Sathan,</hi> conquer the King of feare, and ſhake off all terrible tydings. Keepe it, and it will keepe thee ſafe, amidſt ten thouſand dangers. Sayle thou in this ſhip and it will land thee in ſafetie, when, they that want it ſhall ſplit the barke of their ſoules vpon the rocke of condemnation.</p>
               <p>6. Conſcience as thou haſt worthie attendants in this thy Pilgrimage on earth; ſo thy reward <hi>ſhall be great in heauen.</hi> For, thou ſhalt haue thy ſeat in the noble houſe of the ſoule, till the day of iudgement. <hi>Peace,</hi> ſhall be thy portion, <hi>which paſſeth all vnderſtanding;</hi> and afterward thou ſhalt dwell with Angels, with Chriſt, with God the Father, <hi>where is fulneſſe of ioy, and pleaſures for euermore;</hi> thou ſhalt never die, never whither; no ruſt ſhall eate thee, nor moth conſume thee;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:972:55"/> thou ſhalt ſee no ſorrow; thou ſhalt heare no complaint, neither be afraid of the leaſt evill ſucceſſe. Thou ſhalt iudge the quicke and the dead; acquit the innocent, condemne the guiltie, and doe little leſſe than a pettie God; in one word, thou ſhalt doe more and haue more than can be told by man or by Angell; all that be good before God ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee, preſerue thee, or rather thou them, for ever and ever. And now in the laſt place, let vs make application.</p>
               <p>Then is not that life baſe, that is led without it? A miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> ſervice is that, which is begun, continued, and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a good conſcience; being accompanied with lying, ſwearing, diſſembling and deceiving; is it not? they that thus liue are worſe then beaſts, and no creature (the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill excepted) more wretched. Be thou then aſſured, that ſuch a life is odious to God, hatefull to his Saints, and an vndoubted fore-runner of the ſecond death. He that layeth the foundation of his ſervice with ignorance, infidelitie, and diſobedience, in the fiery tryall, ſhall be blowne vp, when the match of Gods vindicatiue iuſtice ſhall lay hold on this blacke powder, how ſhall that man be able to ſtand? Wee may muzzle the mouth of our conſcience, not ſuffer it to ſpeake: and deale with it, as an vniuſt Land-lord with his poore tenant, when he in ſome iuſt cauſe is to giue evidence againſt him, put it to ſilence by an over ruling commaund; but when Chriſt ſhall come to iudgement, and take part with conſcience, then ſhall it ſpeake freely, boldly, truely, as ever did faithfull witneſſe at the barre, having the chiefe Iudge for his friend. How will a <hi>Iudas</hi> looke at that day, who was ſo pittifully deiected before the Phariſees, whom he tooke for his friends, and expected comfort from them? How will the Drunkard ſtagger and reele, (not with <hi>wine,</hi> but) with the fume of a bad conſcience? What face can the hypocrite hold vp, that hath diſſembled all his life long? where ſhall the vniuſt, the fornicator, adulterer, lyer, with all the wicked and <hi>vngodly appeare?</hi> I am ſure of this, that though ſuch, and a thouſand moe haue blind, erroneous and cauterized conſciences, <hi>burned with an hot yron,</hi> for the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:972:55"/> preſent, yet at that generall aſſize, being lanced with the ſharpe edged knife of Gods revenging hand, they ſhall all bleed freſhly, and to death eternall. This kind of men may looke bigge, ſet the beſt ſide out, eat, drinke, and be merrie; but I ſhall never beleeue, that their hearts laugh with their faces. O matchleſſe miſcreants of all miſchiefe, ſonnes of blood, and ſlaues of perdition; you may ſooner ſeparate your ſoules from your bodies, then conſcience from your ſoules, or damnation from either. Goe then your wayes, laugh and be fat, play and dance, ſing to the Tabret and Harpe, put death, iudgement, and hell farre from you; tread vnder foot the blood of the new couenant, crucifie againe the Lord of life, make a mocke of ſinne, and ſhipwracke your owne conſciences; yet know, that God one day will call you to account, and daſh out your braines with the heele of his vengeance.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer is a calling.</hi>] In Scripture it is ſometimes ſaid to be<note place="margin">I. Math. 7. 7. Mark. 11. 24. Pſal. 25. 1. 1 Sam. 1. 15.</note> a requeſt, an intreatie, a lifting vp of the ſoule, a powring out of the ſpirit, and the like; but moſt commonly, both in the Old and new Teſtament, its noted by this name, <hi>Calling.</hi> When <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed, its ſaid, he called vpon God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 8. &amp; 21. 33. We may ſee the like of <hi>David,</hi> both commanded and practiſed: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 5. &amp; 4. 1. Of <hi>Iob: Iob. 9. 16. Paul</hi> is ſaid to perſecute them, that call vpon God. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 14. And he writ to ſuch as called vpon his name. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. By all which, and many moe places, its plaine, that Prayer is a Calling.</p>
               <p>This calling is either with the tongue, or with the heart<note place="margin">Calling diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted.</note> Whence ariſeth this diſtinction of mentall and vocall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, confirmed by the mouth of Chriſt; <hi>This people honoreth me with their lips; but their hearts are farre from me.</hi> Mat. 15. 8.</p>
               <p>We are to call vpon God with the <hi>tongue.</hi> 1. For we haue<note place="margin">In calling on God, we muſt vſe the tongue and why.</note> this priviledge aboue all other creatures; and ſhall wee not imploy it, in the Lords ſervice? 2. We are to giue vp all our members as ſo many weapons of righteouſneſſe to glorifie him: and is not this one of the principall? And ſome-where <hi>David</hi> calls his tongue his glory. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 13. And it is good for vs ſo to doe. 1. It will be a meanes to keepe our minds from wandring. 2. The voyce ſtirres vp affections, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to an higher temper. 3. In ſo doing, we ſhall find the Lord putting phraſes in our mouth, guiding it now and then in a wonderfull manner, farre beyond all naturall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.

               <p>And the heart may not be ſeparated in this action. 1. For<note place="margin">Alſo the heart and why.</note> ſuch prayers are moſt acceptable to God 2. They onely haue the promiſe to be heard. 3. Otherwiſe they cannot be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent: let a mans breath flow from his mouth, by a narrow paſſage, were the hands hot, it would coole them; but if it proceed from the heart (the lips being wide open) were they cold, it would warme them; ſo prayer that ſprings from the heart, is hot; from the tongue onely, cold as ice. 4. As the Lord is the higheſt obiect we looke at in Prayer; ſo the heart is the loweſt center, he regards in this dutie; theſe two in all holy actions of this nature, may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned.</p>
               <p>1. Vaine then are the prayers of many, who call vpon God, but with the tongue onely. If this be not profane babling, what can be? Thus pray our <hi>Papists,</hi> and rude ignorant <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> ſo prayed the old Phariſees; Chriſt checkes them, yet their cuſtome continues vnto this day.</p>
               <p>But let vs conioyne heart and tongue; elſe wee doe but labour in vaine. What profit can wee expect in bending the knee, bowing the bodie, ſpreading the hands, and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the breaſt, when our hearts are roauing from the Lord? Is this to pray? Is this to call aright? Is this to pleaſe God? Nothing leſſe. What is the tongue, but the hearts meſſenger? He therefore that vſeth the one, and not the other, is like to him that runnes before he hath his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.

And you that flocke to the houſe of God, like Pigeons, looke the Preacher in the face, as if you would eat the word from his mouth, and make publike profeſſion, doe you heare with delight? pray with comfort? and praiſe God with reioycing? are you <hi>rauiſhed in ſpirit on the Lords day?</hi> and account it your Iubile, your heauen? then doubt not of your ſpirituall eſtate: For theſe are the ſparkes of far greater ioy, and the vndoubted fore-runners of euerlaſting pleaſures. But if the wayes of God dampe thy mirth; cary a cold report to thine heart; and, like old <hi>Barzillai,</hi> thou art wearie of men ſinging, and women ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; feeles no more taſt in the bread of life, than hee that hath an ague doth in the white of an egge; thou art but a counterfeit; one that hath a forme, but wants the true fruits of the power of Godlineſſe, and therefore a ſtranger in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>But it will be ſaid, the wicked aſwell as the Godly, haue<note place="margin">A doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued.</note> their ioy in the vſe of the Lords ordinances; where then is the difference? How may it be diſcerned? Why thus. 1. The true Chriſtian hath ſorrow before ſolace; mourning
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:972:70"/> preceedes his mirth: for as at the creation, darknes was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore light; the <hi>Chaos</hi> the comelie creatures: and as the ground is firſt broken, then ſcattered with good ſeed; ſo is it at our regeneration, new creation. We firſt ſee our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, blindnes, confuſion; haue our harts pricked, our ſpirits wounded by the Law; and then followes beautie, comfort, and amendment. But it is not ſo with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: for they haue light before darkneſſe; ioy without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, and bring forth comfort, ere they haue conceiued ſorrow, or felt any panges or throes that accompanie the new birth. The Chriſtian comes to his ioy as an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour to a forreigne Prince, or ſouldiers to the ſpoyle, with preceeding crackes of canons, fireworkes, and garments tumbling in blood; this is the road way to ſound comfort.</p>
               <p>2. A good Chriſtian fetcheth the water of ioy primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from the pure fountaine of iuſtification, not the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſpring of ſanctification; the old man treads the old way, hauing no knowledge or experience of a better; hee lookes for heauen, but by his good deeds. Firſt he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it, and then ſue for poſſeſſion; but the new-man is aſſured, that God indents with no man vpon ſuch termes; onely he relies on his all-ſufficient ſuretie. Did <hi>Zaccheus</hi> purchaſe Chriſt, by his almes? by his fourefold reſtitution? or by faith rather? onely beleeue, is the new way, and the conduit, that conueyes comfort into the Ciſterne of the Soule.</p>
               <p>3. Moreouer, the ioy of a true Chriſtian is of another nature; ſpirituall: the worldlings is carnall; or at the beſt but a baſtardly kind of ſpirituall comfort: for hee wants the ſpirit, he hath no radicall grace planted in his ſoule, that can beare and nouriſh true and ſolide reioycing. Doe men gather <hi>Grapes of thornes? Figs of thiſtles?</hi> then may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall meere naturall men haue ſpirituall ioy, ſound and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned comfort: it were as eaſie to finde an harueſt in an hedge, as this fore named fruit in the heart of the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon.</p>
               <p>4. Finallie, the ioy of the ſound profeſſor is conſtant eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:972:70"/> for the cauſe is conſtant, and abideth for euer: but the formall hypocrites candle ſhall be put out; his ioy ſhall periſh. For the foundation thereof is ſandy, the obiect mutable, and abides but a ſeaſon. Suppoſe, by the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fewell, it ſhould crackle till death; yet then at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, the flame therof ſhall be put forth, neuer more rekind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. So that you ſee what a reall and broad difference is betwixt them.</p>
               <p>And is there ioy to be found in the courſe of a chriſtian?<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3.</note> what then ſhall be had in the kingdome of heauen, did <hi>David</hi> dance before the Arke? how will hee leape before the Lambe? could <hi>Peter</hi> ſing in priſon? and ſhall hee not chante it, being ſet at libertie, with Gods ſonnes? if the gleanings be ſo good, what will the whole harueſt be? ſhall a taſt ſo refreſh the ſoule? then doubtles a full meale muſt needs reuiue, rauiſh the ſpirit. Thinke on this, you that are in this wilderneſſe, ſo ſhall it comfort your hearts, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. For if to ſow, breed ſingle ioy, the reaping will trebble it.</p>
               <p>This muſt perſwade men to take vp the yoke of Chriſt:<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 4.</note> for its eaſie, light: taſt, and ſee, how good the wayes of God be. Men are worſe skard than hurt, when they draw then hand from the worke of the Lord; for great ioy is to be found in well-doing. If this afford not comfort, what can? but the moſt thinke not ſo; therefore they are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the ioys of a Chriſtian. Beginne, I beſeech thee, to auoyd ſinne; caſt off the communion of the wicked; read, heare, pray, and be doing of good, and experience ſhall tell thee, that no ioy is like the ioy of a Chriſtian. Its hid in part from the beſt, totally from the worſt: but if men would make triall, they would ſay of it, as the Queene of <hi>Shebah,</hi> did of <hi>Salomons</hi> wiſdome, that the report is true; but the halfe of it was not told them. For it much exceedes the<note place="margin">1 King. 10.</note> ſame which they heard on't. Finally, we obſerue from theſe words, that,</p>

                  <hi>beleeueth in God, through Chriſt, for ſaluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this deſcription, ſix things are to be conſidered. 1. Its deſcribed by its kind. 2. By its ſubiect, wherein it is reſident 3. By its act or effect. 4. By its proper obiect. 5. By what meanes it commeth vnto it: and finally, by the end for which it is.</p>
               <p>1. I ſay, that <hi>vnfeigned faith,</hi> is, <hi>that faith.</hi>] For wee are to<note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> diſtinguiſh it from a miraculous; which was in <hi>Iudas,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 20.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:972:73"/> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. And from an Hiſtoricall; which may bee found in wicked men, and Deuils. Some make the <hi>Genus</hi> of faith, to be a confidence; others a perſwaſion; a third, a<note place="margin">Act 26. 27. Iam. 2. 19.</note> beleefe; a fourth, a grace, and the like; all which in ſome ſence are true; but I conceiue, that faith is the proper Genus of this faith, as art in generall is the Genus of all arts, if it haue any at all. If I call it a confidence, a perſwaſion, an affiance, I define it by the effects; if a <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>gift,</hi> thats too remote. For ſo is loue, and peace, and hope, and what not? wherefore, we haue rather made choice to define it, as aboue ſaid, <hi>that faith:</hi> for faith is the generall Genus, and the word, <hi>that,</hi> doth make the difference, declare the <hi>ſpecies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here we muſt learne two things. 1. That this faith comprehends in it an hiſtoricall faith. For without the credence of the hiſtorie of the Bible, it cannot ſtand; though the other may, without it. 2. That this faith hath no <hi>ſpecificall difference,</hi> though it may admit of diuerſe degrees; as <hi>Great, little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>By which, a man effectually called.</hi>] Man is the ſubiect, to which this faith adhereth, not Deuils: and man <hi>effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called,</hi> not reprobates; neither is it to be found in the elect themſelues, before effectuall vocation. For that doth in nature and order, (if not in time) precede iuſtification; and ſo conſequently, faith, of neceſſitie. So that <hi>vnfeined faith</hi> dwels in none, but in them that are called, iuſtified. And for this cauſe it may be called the <hi>common faith,</hi> or the faith of the elect; becauſe its onely found in them, that are elected, and common to none other: <hi>Iude 2. Tit.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Beleeueth.</hi>] The forme is the moſt ſubtle of all things: therefore we often, if not alwaies, put the effect for it. For it ſitteth cloſe vpon it, as the lace doth vpon the edge of a Garment, and it beleeueth, according to its degree; either more ſtrongly, as in a great faith; or weakely, as in a leſſer faith. <hi>Rom. 8. 38. &amp;. 14. 1. Math.</hi> 6. 30.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>In God.</hi>] God, he is the adequate, and laſt obiect of faith: the Scripture is not. For then we might pray vnto it. And Chriſt is not neither, conſidered as he is our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour.<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 15. 16.</note>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:972:74"/> For God the father is the creditor: Chriſt but the<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 14. 1.</note> ſuretie. Therefore, faith goeth a ſtep further. Againe, Chriſt is he, in whom the promiſes are made, by the father, <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen;</hi> ſo that faith reſteth not, when it comes<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 20.</note> vnto him. Furthermore, the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> muſt bring vs to that eſtate, which we were in before the fall, and that is, to faith in God the Father. Its true that Chriſt is the obiect of our faith, eſpecially for the matter of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but we reſt not there. God, without Chriſt is our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; for wee are his debtors, and not able to giue him full payment: therefore we goe firſt to Chriſt our ſuretie, and take him, by the hand of faith, in the way; and then paſſe boldly to God the Father, who is our creditour: this muſt<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 6.</note> be marked. For many in this thing are greatly deceiued. For though faith lay hold on many obiects; yet God the Father is the very center or rather ſeat, vpon which, faith at the laſt fixeth it ſelfe, and wholly reſteth; and vntill then, the Soule is not ſetled. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 7.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Through Chriſt.</hi>] Here is laid downe the order of<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 26. Mat. 3. vlt.</note> faith aſcending. The ſpirit leads vs to Chriſt; Chriſt, hee, as a ſecond guide, conducts vs to the Father; and then cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſoule, now <hi>returne vnto thy reſt:</hi> for it is by faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the higheſt ſteppe of its climbing in this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all paſſage.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>For ſalvation.</hi>] Euery thing is for one end or other: and though there be ſubordinate ends of faith; yet the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall is, that we may be ſaued. Before <hi>Adams</hi> fall, it was ſaid, <hi>doe</hi> and <hi>liue:</hi> but ſince, <hi>beleeue and be ſaued. Mat. 16. 16. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>By this that hath beene ſaid, wee ſee, that euery faith is not vnfeigned faith. Againe, that all men haue not vnfeigned faith. Thirdly, that faith muſt reſt in God the father, and none other. Fourthly, That wee muſt goe vnto him by Chriſt, and none other. Fiftly, That faith is not idle, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth more or leſſe. And Laſtly, That it is not vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. For the end of faith is, that we might <hi>obtaine ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, according to promiſe, wee will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:972:74"/> to lay downe ſome proper notes of faith, whereby we may the better know it; and if that it dwell in vs, as it did in <hi>Loïs, Ennice,</hi> and <hi>Timotheus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Let it be remembred, that vnfeigned faith hath two<note place="margin">2. degrees of faith. Luk. 17. 6. Rom. 4. 19.</note> degrees: the one is little, compared to a graine of Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeede; the other great, likened to a ſhip, that is caried with a full gale.</p>
               <p>Againe, Note, that there bee ſome things, that are common to both of theſe degrees, whether great, or litle; and others that are proper but to the one of them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that be common to either, be theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Faith, whether ſtrong or weake, is ſeated in an humble<note place="margin">Sixe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of faith in generall ſtrong or vveake.</note> hart. It groweth not in any other ground, it is not to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in an hard, and vntilled ſoile: but in ſuch as the Lord hath humbled and broken to pieces, by the plow and harrow of the law. Proud hearts, and high minds poſſeſſe it not: <hi>Mat. 8. 8. 10. Luk.</hi> 15. 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Againe, where it is, there will be prayer. This tree will haue its fruit; this fire will either be burning or ſmoking: and tho a ſtrong faith, ſend out ſtrong <hi>cries;</hi> yet a weake in ſome modell, will not be wanting. <hi>Euery true beleever is a Prayer. Act. 9. 14. &amp; 16. 16. Mark.</hi> 9. 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreouer it will purge the heart, where it inhabiteth. Faith is like barme, it will purifie, and cleanſe the perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom it is infuſed, by its proper nature, from the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the fleſh and ſpirit; or in that it aſſureth the ſoule, that no <hi>vncleane thing ſhall inherit heauen.</hi> Therefore, it moueth man to be holy. <hi>Acts. 15. 9. 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe two degrees agree in their obiect. For they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reſt vntill they come to God in Chriſt. This is the way, they both walke; and the onely ſtay, that they both rely and depend on. <hi>Pſal. 20. 7. Io.</hi> 14. 1. 6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beſides, a true faith will apply the promiſes in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: it reſteth not in an implicit or confuſed kind of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: but as the vnderſtanding doth diſtinctly diſcerne them; ſo doth faith ſeuerally, yet diſtinctly apply them; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to doe, were papiſticall, <hi>Iob. 19. 25. Io.</hi> 2. 28.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:972:75"/>
               <p>6. Laſtly; Faith neuer ſeparates the end, and the meanes<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 28.</note> that tend to it. A ſtrong faith will not faile in thus doing; nor a weake faith either. A falſe faith doth put iuſtification,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 2. 3.</note> and Sanctification; mercy and iuſtice; Chriſt, a Sauiour; and Chriſt a Lord, a ſunder; theſe all be common both to<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 2. 3.</note> the one and the other, whether weake faith or ſtrong. And thoſe that finde not theſe in themſelues, haue no true faith at all.</p>
               <p>A greatfaith, hath ſome excellent properties, and effects, which are not ſo proper to a weaker.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One is, to praiſe God in the greateſt affliction: <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. 21.<note place="margin">Properties of a great faith.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another, not to make haſt out of troubles; but with patience to ſtay the Lords leyſure; being aſſured, that great and long afflictions, ſhall do them more good, than if they were leſſer, ſhorter. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 16.</p>

Finally, to long and looke for, the comming of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> vnto iudgement; and deſiring <hi>to be looſed, which is beſt of all.</hi> Theſe be ſome attendants that accompanie a great faith. For a weake faith is often impatient in ſmall trials, forward to make haſt, both in reſpect of time; and in vſing vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, now and then: It liueth too much by ſight and ſence, and doth not mount on high; is eaſie and apt to take a deniall in prayer; feareth death, iudgment, and hell; &amp; therefore cryeth <hi>ſtay thine hand a while, that I may gather</hi>

               <p>The weake vnfeined faith, hath theſe things to be found<note place="margin">Properties of a weake faith.</note> with it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A true and cleere ſight of the want of it. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A prizing it aboue all earthly things. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 46.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An earneſt longing after it. <hi>Acts.</hi> 16. 30.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A carefull and conſtant vſe of the meanes to obtaine it <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 33.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A reſolution to ſinne no more. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 36.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A great ſorrow, they found the want of faith no ſooner;<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 19.</note> yet mixed with ſome ioy, that now at the laſt, before it bee too late, they haue eſpied it: not without this reſolution neither; that let God doe what ſeemeth beſt to his Maieſtie yet they will ſtill ſue vnto him for mercie.</p>
               <p>He that findeth theſe things in himſelfe, findeth a good thing: for aſſuredly vnfeigned faith is rooted in his heart; and though for the preſent it be but as a ſeed, yet, before long, in the daily vſe of Gods ordinances it will ſpring, ſpread, and proue as a great and large <hi>Cedar.</hi> This muſt comfort thoſe that be weake in the faith, that they bee not; for the preſent, (vntill faith grow ſtronger in their owne apprehenſion) ſwallowed vp of ouermuch heauines.</p>
               <p>Now in the third place, the lets that hinder men from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining<note place="margin">Hinderances, of faith in the Preacher.</note> of this vnfeigned faith, are to bee diſcouered: and they are partly to be found in the Preacher, partly in the people.</p>
               <p>In the preacher. 1. When he doth not preach at all; but <hi>lie and ſleepe and delight in ſleeping.</hi> Of whom I may ſay, as Chriſt did ſomtimes of the dumbe Diuell; that this kind is not <hi>to be caſt out but by prayer and faſting. Mark.</hi> 9. 29.</p>
               <p>2. When men preach, yet rarely, as Papiſts come to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:972:76"/> Church according to the ſtatute; but more to ſaue their liuings, than their owne ſoules and others. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. vlt.</p>
               <p>3. When, though they preach often, yet their Sermons, as <hi>Gallio</hi> ſaid of Religion, are but a matter of <hi>names and words;</hi> and a ſcraping together of fables, and vaine Phyloſophie. <hi>Coll.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>4. When, the preacher maketh wrong application, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that vpon Gods people, which is the portion of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate. This is the old cuſtome of falſe Prophets, who<note place="margin">Ezek. 13. 22.</note> grieued the harts of the Godly, and hardned the wicked in ſo doing, by promiſing them life. Wherefore, often, ſound powerfull and plaine preaching, is the way to worke vnfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned faith in the people.</p>
               <p>Lettes in the people be many; yet few here ſhall be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.<note place="margin">Letts of faith in the people.</note> One is a vaine perſwaſion, that all men haue it, from their birth. A ſecond is, in that the people thinke it not a thing of great worth or neceſſitie. A third is, a deſperate idlenes, which makes men negligent in the vſe of the meanes. The fourth is, a ſetled reſolution to liue in ſinne for a ſeaſon; and ſo, if they be cut off in the meane time, yet, they haue made this concluſion, that then they will caſt themſelues vpon the hidden, and vnſearchable mercie of God. This is to hang a mans Saluation, (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes of<note place="margin">Iob. 26. 7.</note> the earth) iuſt, vpon nothing. But, if by any meanes ſuch men might be allured; we will adde ſome motiues, in the laſt place, to perſwade them to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider how often the Lord doth intreat vs to get faith, and beleeve in him. Might not this moue an heart<note place="margin">Motiues to get faith.</note> of ſtone to this duty? who would not (out of his priuate iudgement) condemne ſuch a man that will not obey him, who doth begge and beſeech, that might command and kill?</p>
               <p n="2">2. And is it not the onely way to get reſt to our ſoules, and to procure peace, <hi>that paſſeth all vnderſtanding?</hi> What perſon is he, that priſeth not this peace, that doth not wiſh for ſo great a fauour?</p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:972:76"/>
               <p n="3">3. Who euer came to Chriſt and went away vncured? the verie diuels, that ſought vnto him, ſometimes had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: and ſhall wee doubt, or once deſpaire to ſpeede, if we approach to his preſence? Is it poſſible that he will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promiſe to his people? <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Call to mind, how cheap wee may haue this commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. We may buy it without gold or ſiluer. If wee bring empty hands, yet honeſt harts, we ſhall not goe home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Let vs but aske it, and we ſhall haue it. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How many are the priuiledges that accompanie it? By<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 12. 2 Pet. 1. 4. Eph. 6. 16. 1 Ioh. 5. 4.</note> it we are vnited to Chriſt, made the ſonnes of God, partake of the diuine nature, quench the fierie darts of Sathan, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, and are ſaued.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And if nothing will moue thee to get faith vnfeigned,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 8.</note> and to beleeue in the Lord; yet let the fearefull iudgements, that are threatned againſt infidels, preuaile with thee. Shall not ſuch be caſt into the lake that burneth with fire and Brimſtone for euer; which is the ſecond death? <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8.</p>
               <p>And let me wind vp all in a ſhort application, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. I ſay that to all, which I doe to one, <hi>get faith, keepe faith, and increaſe your faith:</hi> a mite of this graine is worth a million of gold; a ſtalke of this faith, a ſtanding tree of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruites; a ſoule fraughted and filled with this treaſure, all the coffers of ſiluer in the whole world. What can I more ſay? the leaſt true faith is of more value, than large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, ſtately buildings, and tenne thouſand riuers of oyle. If the Mountaines were Pearle, the huge Rocks pretious ſtones, and the whole Globe a ſhining Chriſolite; yet faith, as much as the leaſt droppe of water, graine of ſand, or ſmalleſt Muſtard-ſeed; is more worth than all. This will ſwimme with his Maſter; hold vp his drouping head, and land him ſafe at the ſhore, againſt all winds, and weather, ſtormes, and tempeſts: ſtriue then, for this fraught. For the time and tyde thereof ſerueth, but once, and not for euer.</p>

                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1.</note> demanded. The one is, in what part of man, faith is feated; the other, whether it continue in the world to come for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>Vnto the firſt, I anſwer, that faiths ſeat is in the will; that<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1.</note> is the proper ſubiect of its habitation. And the Scripture ſeeme to confirme this, placing faith in the heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1 12.<note place="margin">Where faith is ſeated.</note> 7. <hi>Acts 8. 37. Rom.</hi> 10. 10. Yet here is a trope; for by hart is ment the will, which is in the heart. So that, if the will bee in the heart, and faith in the will; then faith may be affirmed to be in the heart, <hi>example.</hi> If there be wine in the Butte, and the Butte be in the Ship, then its a truth, that there is wine in the ſhip: For that which comprehendeth the ſubiect, comprehendeth what is conteined in the ſubiect. And the reaſons be theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Diuinitie is the rule of the will; that therefore, which is immediatly ruled by it, muſt be in the will; as for the body, and the parts of it, they are but guided by diuinitie at the ſecond hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith is ſaid to be the ground of things hoped for; now hope is in the heart. Therefore faith: elſe make the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in one place, and the building in another; what more abſurd?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith muſt haue a ſeat, where it may haue the beſt roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: and that is in the will. For an error or truth in the vnderſtanding is ſoone remooued; but if either paſſe to the will, then they ſticke faſt; as in their proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is where it worketh. And doth it not, like a ſtrong hand, pull Chriſt into the heart, purifie the heart, and worke by loue, as by an inſtrument in its fiſt, that is ſeated in the heart? <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
               <p>They that haue placed faith in the vnderſtanding, are ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deceiued. We grant that the rules of faith are firſt in the vnderſtanding; as of all other arts, but faith is not ſeated there. And this may be the cauſe, why knowledge is often
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:972:78"/> put for faith, becauſe that muſt be firſt; or the other can bee neuer. And there is alſo a logicall aſſent in the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the truth of a thing; but that may be found in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men &amp; Devils. For as the externall ſence, conueyeth <hi>ſpecies</hi> to the internall; ſo doth the vnderſtanding put them ouer to the will, where faith being reſident, ſtretcheth forth her hand and maketh that good, which the vnderſtanding did iudge for truth. For as the eye of the body guides the hand; ſo doth the eye of the mind the will: and as we firſt ſee, then worke; ſo we firſt know, then beleeue. And to holde this for a truth, ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Concerning the continuance of faith, there be diuerſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. Some thinke, it ends at death; others, at the day of<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſ.</note> iudgement: but what if we hold, that it dwels in the ſoule for eternity? there can be no danger at al in that; but rather on the contrarie. And this poſition hath ſtrong reaſon; which may ſeeme ſufficient to confirme it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For doth not the Obiect of faith continue for euer? if<note place="margin">Whether true faith remaine for euer.</note> the obiect, then faith. For the better vnderſtanding of this, I'le ſtand a litle to explane my meaning. We muſt obſerue, that in Chriſt, God the Father hath made many promiſes; ſome of this life, others of the life to come; thoſe of the firſt kind ceaſe. For man being once made Spirituall hath no neede of corporall food or rayment. Now for the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, we are to conſider two things in them. 1. The truth of them; or 2. The extent of them. At the comming of our Lord, they ſhall all be accompliſhed, not one of them ſhall faile; yet there is a promiſe of continuance in that condition, which yet is to be beleeued; <hi>example.</hi> My Father doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me many kindneſſes, and at ſuch a day he will giue me a good farme for euer. Now in this, there bee two things obſeruable. The one is, the time of poſſeſſion; the other the continuance. When my Father hath put me in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a part of the promiſe ceaſeth, as it is iuſt; but the other part is ſtill of force, and I beleeue my Fathers word; and by vertue of that, I doe ſtill inioy my liuing; and thus it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and his children. All the promiſes hee hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:972:79"/> or will at the day of iudgement; and then hee putteth his Sonnes into full poſſeſſion: yet haue not they a promiſe from him, to remaine there for euer? So that faith doth ſtill continue, to beleeue the continuance of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which they haue in fruition, and no otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And is it not comfortable to be aſſured, that as they haue fulneſſe of ioy, ſo it ſhall be for euer? <hi>Adam</hi> was in a good condition in the Garden; but God neuer gaue him a promiſe. For his abiding in that eſtate hee ſtood was ſo, as he might fall, and the euent proued; yet the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs a ſure word, that we ſhall neuer be moued. And is it not faith, that muſt by application, perſwade vs thereof, and fill our hearts, like a neuer dying ſpring, with vnſpeakable ioy? What a miſery were it for a man to be put into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an houſe, but no aſſurance to enioy it? had hee a good leaſe and could read it, then hearing it, he reioyceth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not. Now the ſonnes of God may be glad. For they haue a leaſe in their hands, and by the eye of faith reade it continually. So that, they neuer feare diſpoſſeſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When is faith made perfect? in earth or heauen? What then becomes of it? is it annihilated? by whom? either by vs, or he that wrought it.

               <p n="4">4. I would demaund, from what our good actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, as from their proper cauſe? is it not from faith? why are we no more holy? is it not want of faith? let this then be granted, and faith muſt of neceſſitie continue. For elſe holineſſe would ceaſe alſo. And if we hold, as ſome doe, that faith is the eſſentiall forme of a Chriſtian; and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good act comes from it, as naturall acts from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per formes; then who can deny the propoſition?</p>
               <p>But againſt this, it will be obiected, that now <hi>abideth faith,</hi>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:972:79"/> commended aboue faith and hope, but wherein? why they two worke inwardly, and their effects are more ſecret, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying, <hi>haſt thou faith? haue it with thy ſelfe</hi>

For that which produceth ſuch a thing; muſt needes be better than that it effecteth: becauſe it cannot communicate its whole nature to its effect, or what it hath not in it ſelf. This is that excellent way to demonſtrate to the Church, that I am a true member of it; when I am louing and charitable to my brethren. 3. Many boaſted of faith yet wanted workes: <hi>if they had workes,</hi> yet they did them out of ſiniſter reſpect, and not in loue: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it. 4. The word; now, doth not denotate alwayes an adiunct, period, or any part of time; but a kind of aſſeuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or affirmation, and the like: and when it doth; yet the Greekes vſe it ſometimes; for time future: and not for the preſent. And ſo much for this obiection.</p>
               <p>But it will be further obiected, that wee haue no neede of<note place="margin" type="runSum">

And though the bleſſednes wee poſſeſſe, be preſent; yet eternity is not. Wherefore, faith, runneth on, holding the promiſe by the end, to eternitie. It beleeueth no more; but keepeth faſt what it hath. A man going vp many ſteps, when he commeth to the higheſt ſeat of his wiſhed deſire, hath neede of ſomewhat to hold him there: ſo faith hauing paſſed all the promiſes, now onely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth the ſoule of what it hath in poſſeſſion.</p>

               <p>2. They muſt be ſubiect to their husbands, <hi>that though they obey not the word; yet they may without the word, by their good conuerſation, be wonne to the word.</hi> 1. Pet. 3. 1. The wiues good actions, muſt be their husbands inſtructions.</p>
               <p>3. Let this teach them to loue Chriſt their firſt husband, the more perfectly. For by the badnes of the one, you may iudge the better of the goodnes of the other. This is to draw good out of euill, and worthy to be remembred.</p>
               <p>4. Such muſt admire the mercy of God to them, that they had not themſelues beene bad, their husbands good; and liue in hope, that through the bleſſing of the Almighty, they may proue inſtruments to ſaue their ſoules. And if this fall out, how would that man affect, then, his wife? more than euer he diſliked her.</p>
               <p>From this doctrine, the women, maids, or widowes, that<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 4.</note> intend to marry, may learne a leſſon; to beware in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, leaſt they fall into the like condition. And the better to direct thee, let theſe rules be obſerued in the choyce of an husband.</p>
               <p>In the choyce of an husband (or a wife either: for the<note place="margin">How to chooſe a good husband.</note> rules will hold in that reſpect alſo) two things muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>garded firſt the perſon, ſecondly the portion.</p>
               <p>The perſon is to be reſpected afore the portion, for diuers reaſons. 1. For he is of more worth. 2. He being bad may ſoone miſ-ſpend it. 3. What comfort can that woman haue in goods, her husband wanting grace? and 4. Otherwiſe,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:972:82"/> ſhe may be ſaid, not to marrie the man, but the money. We muſt croſſe the worlds cuſtome, and firſt ſay, what is <hi>he?</hi> then, <hi>what hath he?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in the perſon two things are to be conſidered; the one, grace, the other nature. Grace muſt be regarded in the election, and much ſet by. For what is beauty, or birth, or wealth without this, but very vanity? And, in grace, wee may conſider; either the truth of it, or the degree of it. If we (in the iudgement of charitie) finde ſome beginnings and ſome ſprouts of this tree, wee may not reiect ſuch a plant: for it will grow, and in time come to greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but if we finde none at all, this is not to <hi>marry in the Lord. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 39.</p>
               <p>Some may demand, may not one marry with one, that<note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> hath not (ſo farre as ſhe can iudge) any ſauing grace at all? being tractable and hopefull?</p>
               <p>Diuerſe anſwer diuerſly; but I ſay, the ſafeſt way is to<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſ.</note> make a good things as ſure as we can. And its a ſafe courſe, when we haue choyce, to chooſe the beſt. Nay take heed, that he, whom thou art well perſwaded of, doe not deceiue thee, and proue bad enough.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be reſpected in the perſon is the nature or his diſpoſition: the which will be more meeke and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, auſtere and froward. A little grace, in a crooked crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed nature, will not eaſily be perceiued; in a good tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature it will, and ſhew excellent. Wherefore, if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, conſtitution, and complexion content thee aſwell, as grace, there will bee the greateſt, ſtrongeſt, and durableſt bond of affection.</p>
               <p>It is a fault in ſome, that are careleſſe in this reſpect, and cry; giue me grace, and let him be crooked, or deformed, or froward, that will neuer trouble me. Thou art deceiued, my friend; a little Sugar in ſweete wine, makes it excellent; but a great quantitie in tart will not change the taſt: ſo when grace and nature doe both anſwere thy deſires, then will thy loue and content be the greater. Wee haue in our ſelues a double man, and if thou canſt pleaſe both, <hi>vſe it rather</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:972:83"/> Next the goodnes of the cloth, regard the colour: and when thou haſt found grace, haue an eye to nature.</p>
               <p>The ſecond generall thing, is the portion; maintenance muſt be had, or loue will waxe cold.

               <p>By all this wee may be directed, how to know a good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and a very good; or a bad, and a very bad husband.</p>

Indeed, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we deſire lands. For wanting much faith, wee liue by ſence; and earth is leaſt ſubiect to be remoued from vs.</p>
               <p>And on the contrarie, when men are not ſanctified, of a froward diſpoſition, and neither haue goods in hand or in hope, theſe muſt needs proue, if the Lord worke not aboue mans reach) euill husbands, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The Grandmother, the mother, and the mothers ſonne, had the ſame faith, and the like fruits proceeded from them: elſe <hi>Paul</hi> would neither haue called it, <hi>vnfeigned,</hi> or ſaid that it dwelt in them; or giuen them all three one and the ſame teſtimony. All three had faith, and vnfeigned faith. For the likenes of actions were in them, and proceeded from them, by the which it was called vnfeigned, and equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to each particular perſon. And it is an vndoubted poſition, that faith produceth the like effects, in all Gods children; in <hi>truth,</hi> it muſt bee vnderſtood, not in degree. For as faith increaſeth, the effectes are bettred. Many Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes, with ſeuerall Candles, will all giue light; but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their diuerſe degrees and quantities. Euery peece hath his report, but according to the bignes: and each inſtrument will ſound, but variouſly as they be in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Becauſe faith differs not in kind, but in degree; and like<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> cauſes produce like effects. Euery Bell hath its ſound. Each ſtone its weight; and ſeuerall planets, their diuerſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: yet not in the ſame meaſure, though they may varie in kind.</p>
               <p>Againe, faith is diffuſed into ſubiect, though ſeuerall; yet<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> they are the ſame in nature, and conſiſt of like principles. Fire, put into ſtraw, will either ſmoke or burne; let the bundle be a thouſand: life, in the bodie, will haue motion, though not in the ſame degree and meaſure; and reaſon, in euery man acteth, but not ſo exquiſitely. The conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may not be alike: therefore a difference may be in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naturall; and alſo, from the ſame ground, in acts ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. A darke horne in the Lanthorne, dimmes the light ſomewhat.</p>
               <p>Faith is begot, and increaſed by the ſame originals: the<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3.</note> ſpirit and the word be both the principall and conſeruing

Here, by the way, we may ſee, that thoſe mothers, (if a forced neceſſity compell not) who bring forth and bear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> children; yet haue no care to nurſe them, are to be blamed for ſo doing; in that they differ from Gods manner of proceeding. And in the laſt place, if faith had not like effects in all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4.</note> then could they not attaine to one and the ſame ends; as iuſtification, ſanctification, ſaluation, &amp;c. And ſo ſhould it be in vaine, the Lord failing, and man too, of their chiefe ſcope and purpoſe. Hath not God made euery eie to ſee? and hand to worke? and ſhall we then iudge, that faith ſhall not act, but be idle? away with that.</p>
               <p>From this point, we may learne, how to iudge of the faith in our times, which ſo many boaſt of: they cry, haue<note place="margin" type="runSum">

Doe not wee beleeue aſwell, as the beſt? but where be the fruits of faith vnfeigned? haſt thou an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and purging heart? doſt thou call vpon God at al times, tary his leaſure, and rely vpon his promiſe? art thou bold and reſolute for good cauſes? canſt thou reſiſt Sathan? cleaue to God, and ſhunne the appearances of euill? will neither pouerty ouerpreſſe thee, by deſpaire; or proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by preſumption? Why, its well, and we beleeue, that Faith is to be found in thee: but if not, thou haſt it not roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thee. For the tree is knowne by the fruit. Will not the flower ſmell? the candle giue light? and the fire heate? and ſhall true faith be without her effects? boaſt not too much, leſt thou deceiue thy ſelfe, taking the ſhadow for the body; and that which is not, for that which ſhould be.</p>
               <p>And this doctrine is of great comfort for them, that often call the truth of faith into queſtion. But haſt thou the true<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.</note> ſignes of it? then thou haſt it. What if it worke not ſo mightily as in others? will it follow that thou art without it? ſuppoſe thou wert carried to the toppe of ſome high

When men, in heart and life, are like the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let them be aſſured they haue the ſame faith. It may differ in ſome degree: yet, the quantity greater or leſſer, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not the kind of it. Leauen is leauen, though neuer ſo litle; and, if the meale bee ſeaſoned, it is to be found in the lumpe.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3.</note> for in ſo doing, wee may bee blame worthy. Let a poore Chriſtian cry out, that hee is tempted of Sathan, troubled with doubting, and call his eſtate into queſtion, the which is vſuall in the Lords children, ſhall we not haue ſome that will tell it in <hi>Gath,</hi> that ſuch are haunted of the Deuill, brought to deſpaire, and not of the number of the faithfull? but theſe grieue the holy Ghoſt, wound their own fleſh, or rather declare euidently, that they are ſtrangers from the life of God.</p>
               <p>Let the Magiſtrate, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> repreſſe impiety, ſuffer not the offender to goe with out penalty; and if he be reſolute to advance religion, how many will be ready to tell, that he takes too much vpon him? If the zealous Preacher, with <hi>Iohn,</hi> put the axe to the roote of the tree, laſh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſpeake with power, what exclamations will fly, like vncoucht fire workes? this man is without mercy, damnes vs all; and ſends our ſoules to hell, afore our bodies be cold. When men pray in their families, ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſing Pſalmes, Catechize their children, and frequent the houſe of God; ſhall not ſuch be counted Puritanes, nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Preciſians? And yet doe but looke into Gods booke, and tell me, if all the faithfull haue not done theſe things? and the profane, as branded to deſtruction, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them? but theſe grunting Swine are neuer ſatisfied: ſuch Dogs will vomit vp their filth; and every Kyte of that neſt, caſt vp his ſtinking gorge. And what wonder iſt? for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:972:86"/> will follow his kind, and like grace, produce the contrary effects to her from oppoſite principles. For Chriſt was counted a wine-bibber; <hi>Iohn</hi> reputed to haue a Deuill; the faithfull to be full <hi>of new wine;</hi> &amp; the ſame cenſure, muſt and ſhall accompany the members, and cleaue to the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. Yet let vs take heed, leſt falling into the ſame ſinne, we one day partake not of the ſame puniſhment, or the like.</p>

               <p>Hath the Lord called thee, to practice that great art of ſoule ſauing? and is thy care, ſo to preach and practiſe, as that thou maiſt ſaue thine owne ſoule, and them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon thee? and doſt thou yearne, for the gathering together the ſcattered Saints? to build vp the body of Chriſt? and wiſh, (might it ſtand with Gods pleaſure) that all other with thy ſelfe, were in the path, that leadeth to heauen?</p>

               <p>Fourthly, As fire doth congregate things homogeneall,<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4.</note> but ſegregate heterogeneall; ſo doth faith and grace. It will diſſolue things of diuerſe natures, but vnite the other. Grace will caſt out the ſinner, but receiue the Saint; yea make <hi>diuiſions in a mans owne houſe,</hi> and yet cauſe vnion with <hi>Gentile, Barbarian, Sythian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, fire will convert other things into it ſelfe, as we ſee<note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p>Sixtly, the nature of fire is to goe vpward, and to carry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin" type="runSum">

For the fire being vnited with it, would carry it vpward; but being not able, it fals downeward; ſo grace will aſcend on high, pierce the verie heauens, and indeuours to draw others alſo: though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it fals out with it as with the fire. For meeting with a cold ſubiect, it loſeth its labour, and cooleth it ſelfe for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, fire is the moſt actiue of all other elements,<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7.</note> hauing much forme but litle matter; and ſo is grace. For where it is, it will be working, not idle.</p>
               <p>Finally, fire comes downe by accident, through the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 8.</note> of the ſunne, thats placed in it; and were it not for the Sonne of righteouſneſſe, grace would neuer deſcend from on high, into this low region.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:972:91"/> aske the Sunne, why hee ſhineth, and the fire why it heateth, and they will tell thee, its their nature to doe ſo: and ſo is it the nature of grace to ſhine like a ſtarre in a darke night amongſt the wicked, and be hotteſt in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt froſt of perſecution; and to ſtrike the higheſt tower in pieces, aſwell as deuoure the dryeſt ſtubble.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Wicked workes;</hi> they raſe the foundation; and like the Boare of the wood roote vp all: when theſe breake forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to action, then fals grace ſuddenly into a conſumption: for they doe not onely wither the branches, and change the

               <p>From the words diuerſly conſidered, might many more doctrines be collected; as that,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>There may be increaſe of grace in the beſt Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Timotheus</hi> was an excellent man before this time; and were not his gifts now augmented?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That a Miniſter hath neede of more grace than a common Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:972:95"/>
               <p>This is the reaſon his gifts were increaſed.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>That the more worthie calling God ſets vs in, the greater portion of his ſpirit will he powre vpon vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He did ſo by <hi>Timotheus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>That preachers may (aboue others) depend vpon God for a bleſſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, are they not conſecrated with great care and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? enriched with extraordinarie gifts and graces? Think on this, O ye men of God, and in contempt of the world, let the honour of your calling, and hope of good ſucceſſe in the faithfull execution, comfort your ſoules, and breed an vndaunted reſolution in you.</p>

               <p>Secondly, And it is an act, <hi>of the Will,</hi> not of the tongue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or hand; for, 1. Divinitie is the rule of the <hi>Will</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though of the whole man mediately. 2. Againe, if loue were not an act, ariſing from the will, but from an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeated in the heart (as the moſt hold,) then ſhould loue ceaſe in the Saints at their deathes, and the Angels never haue it, the which may not be admitted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the third place, we affirme, that <hi>this act em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth the obiect beloved.</hi> For, 1. The nature of loue is to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite it ſelfe to the thing loued, as the hand taketh hold of what the eye beholdeth. And 2. ſhould not the Will after its extenſion be conioyned to the obiect affected, it would never be at reſt and ſetled. 3. Hatred reiecteth; therefore loue embraceth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It embraceth <hi>with delight:</hi> for, 1. As every flower hath its ſmell: ſo every action in Divinitie is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with delight, and comfort, none excepted. 2. Beſides, the Will doth imbrace whats offered to it as good, and the fruition of a good thing muſt needes breed delight, elſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>Whatſoever:</hi> Here note the latitude of the obiect of loue; for it may be either truth or errour, good or euill, perſon, or thing, by accident; and the reaſon is. 1. In that the vnderſtanding may preſent to the will an apparant truth, for the truth it ſelfe: As the ſilly fiſh catcheth the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit flie for the naturall, through miſapprehenſion. And 2. the will may be ſo much corrupted, though it be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:972:101"/> that it may with delight embrace the thing that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, as we may ſee in wicked men and deuills.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Whatſoeuer, is; <hi>firſt approued by the vnderſtanding:</hi> In this ſentence, we ſee the order of the wills act; for the vnderſtanding precedes it in acting, as the eye the foote. The reaſon is. 1. becauſe of an vnknowne thing, there can be no loue or deſire: and 2. as whatſoeuer is in the inward ſence, was firſt in the outward: ſo whatſoeuer thing is in the will, was formerly in the vnderſtanding. It is with the inner man as with the outward: The eye may be compared to the vnderſtanding the feete likened to the affections, and the hand to the will: the eye beholds the obiect, the feete carrie vnto it, and then the hand takes it by acting: ſo the vnderſtanding iudgeth, then loue coveteth; and the Will as the hand worketh for it, if it be not poſſeſſed: if it be, then it indeuours to retaine it ſtill. Now from this that hath beene ſayd, many things may be deduced.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That, <hi>They that know not God, cannot loue him:</hi> Ignorant<note place="margin">Corrolaries from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition.</note> perſons haue not the loue of God. For from the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding proceeds ſound affection, and there is no deſire of what we know not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Errour in the vnderſtanding deceiveth the affection:</hi> for loue takes things as they are preſented, and iudged; if the one be deceived, the other is alſo. This is manifeſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Beſides, I conclude hence, that, <hi>The affection is more worthy than the vnderſtanding;</hi> and <hi>the Will, than both.</hi> For, that which is for another, is of leſſe dignitie, than the thing for which it is. The <hi>Sabbath was for man;</hi> the <hi>Woman for man;</hi> therefore Man is more worthy than either.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreouer, this followeth alſo, that, <hi>The affections doe immediately attend the vnderſtanding,</hi> as we receiue obiects; and are in the firſt act <hi>Patients:</hi> ſo, then they importune the Will, like an earneſt ſuiter, to worke for what they affect: for the Will commands them actiuely. When God workes to man, he beginnes at the outward and inward ſences, and ends his worke at the <hi>Will</hi> as the Center. And, when man workes to God, and for him; his act beginnes at the Will,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:972:102"/> but ends at the externall and extreame parts and members.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the next place, it will follow from the fore going definition, that; <hi>They who loue God, haue inward ioy:</hi> for loue alwayes receiues its obiect with great delight. And little doth the world know, what melodie, the children of God haue in their hearts: <hi>no ſtranger can intermeddle with their ioy.</hi> For from the beſt intellect, and beſt obiect, proceeds the moſt comfort; and the faithfull haue both.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And laſtly, we may ſafely gather, that, <hi>Such people as doe not embrace the Lord, and endeuour not ſtill to be vnited to him, did neuer truely loue him.</hi> For the nature of loue is to be alwayes preſent, and to become one with the thing ſhee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> louing vs, became <hi>Emanuel, God with vs,</hi> and hath promiſed neuer to <hi>leaue nor forſake vs.</hi> And if <hi>Iacob</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Rachel,</hi> he would be eſpouſed to her. For by marriage they are made one fleſh, vnited in the neereſt bond.</p>
               <p>In the next place, we come to handle <hi>Loue,</hi> as it hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its obiect; Whence we may note: that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gods children loue God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This is a ſhort point in words, but long in worke; ſoone proued, of many confeſſed; yet of a few practiſed. <hi>Pſal. 46. 7. &amp; 73. 25. &amp; 97. 10. Col. 3. 14. 1 Io.</hi> 4. 19.</p>
               <p>For, they haue the beſt <hi>intellect;</hi> therefore affect the beſt<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> obiect; which is <hi>God:</hi> the acuteſt eye couets the choiceſt colours; the quickeſt ſence, the ſweeteſt ſmell; ſo the beſt vnderſtanding the beſt obiect.</p>
               <p>Againe, they preferre many Petitions to him, and he<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> granteth their deſires, by the remotion of euill, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of good: Hence, <hi>Dauid,</hi> I loue the Lord, becauſe <hi>he hath heard my Prayer:</hi> will we not loue him, that neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies vs any thing we requeſt? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 1.</p>
               <p>Before we apply the point, we will lay downe ſome ſound ſignes, inſeparable properties of this loue.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What thing doe we ſee in God, worthy of our affection?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Trials of the loue of God.</note> When the ſonnes of God, ſaw the daughters of men <hi>to be faire,</hi> then, they made <hi>choice</hi> of them: Doe we loue his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of mercy, and knowledge, and preſence, and iuſtice?
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:972:102"/> for he that loues God, loues all that is in God, and ſeeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but good in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Doe we <hi>deſire to be acquainted with him, and he with vs?</hi> For this is the propertie of true affection; that as we know and would better know him whom we affect: ſo we would be knowne of him, that loueth vs: they that are ſtrangers in this, are ſtrangers from the grace of <hi>loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Would we haue God to loue vs reciprocally?</hi> For if we loue any, we would be equally affected of him; els our loue ſhould be loſt, and our <hi>ioy not full.</hi> Is it not ſo betwixt friend and friend? how ſhould it be otherwiſe than betwixt the ſonnes of God, and their hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enly Father?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Furthermore, if we loue God, we then deſire to be like him. 1. In nature, being conformed into his image. 2. In actions too, into the conſimilitude of his proceedings. For we haue ſuch a deepe conſideration, and good perſwaſion of what we affect, that we thinke all perfection to be in it, and to flow from it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Againe, they that truely loue the Lord, thinke all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould doe the ſame. See this in <hi>Mary;</hi> ſhe thought<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 15.</note> others mindes were buſied about no other thing, but her Lord; the Church in the <hi>Canticles</hi> did the ſame. For they ſee admirable things in the obiect beloued, to be deſired.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In concluſion, if God be affected of vs, we will vſe all meanes to <hi>pleaſe him,</hi> to retaine his fauour, and doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to diſcontent him; yea, the nature of loue is ſuch that it reioyceth greatly, to haue any occaſion offered, whereby it may manifeſt its vnfeigned affection, to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect beloued.</p>
               <p>And are theſe things true? then vndoubtedly the loue of<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> God is rare in the world: it is not like fire, kindled on the hearth of euery mans heart; or graſle that groweth in each kinde of ground. Euery one will cry, he knoweth as much as the Preacher can teach him: <hi>viz: To loue God aboue all, and his neighbour as himſelfe.</hi> But, what admirable things doe theſe ſee in God? What deſire haue they to know him, and he knowne of him? that the Lord would loue them? or they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:972:103"/> to become like him in perſon, and action? doe they wonder that others do not loue him? take they care to pleaſe him in al things, to offend him in nothing? the contrarie is manifeſt: Wherefore, whatſoeuer they bragge and boaſt, the loue wee ſpeake of, was neuer ſhed abroad in their hearts: this herbe is a ſtranger from the garden of their mindes. Be not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; for if theſe things be not, in truth, though not in degree, found in thee, thou art an hater of him, and a louer of profit and pleaſure, and not <hi>of God. Davids</hi> heart guſhed out <hi>teares,</hi> when others kept not his law: theſe themſelues rent his precepts, like the vaile of the Temple, <hi>from the toppe to the bottome:</hi> Dauid ſet him alwaies at his right hand, theſe neuer haue him in their <hi>thoughts: David trembled at his word;</hi> theſe feare not to ſweare by his holy name. <hi>David</hi> did <hi>meditate of him day and night;</hi> theſe cry, <hi>Depart from me, we will none of thy wayes. David made ſonges to praiſe him;</hi> theſe write bookes, and coyne oathes to diſhonour him: David bad the louers of God; <hi>to hate iniquitie;</hi> theſe call others to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all villany. Shall they then haue <hi>Davids</hi> portion? nay, how <hi>can they eſcape ſwift damnation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, ſeeing wee haue ſeene what it is to<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>loue the Lord,</hi> and the true attendants that accompanie the ſame; let vs neuer be at reſt or quiet, vntill theſe letters of loue be engrauen on the tables of our affections, and imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the leaues of our mindes; and to moue thee to this, take theſe directions following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt of neceſſitie loue ſomething; for as no place<note place="margin">Motiues to loue God.</note> in nature will admit of a vacuitie, ſo all mens affections will couet ſome obiect; then loue God, for hee is the beſt thing. Take what goodneſſe is in all the creatures, its no more equall to him, than a drop of water to the whole Ocean; he is all faire, and there is nothing vnlouely in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider alſo, what a neere vnion is betwixt vs and him,</hi> hath not he tooke vpon him our nature? married vs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? is he not <hi>bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh?</hi> and ſhall not this moue vs to loue him? what neerer? or more honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bond? what can be of greater force to allure our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:972:103"/> ſhall the creator thus ſtoupe to the creature, and we not loue him?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They that loue him, ſhall not loſe their labour:</hi> and is not this ſomething? ſometime we loue him, and her, ſetting on our affections as the <hi>Bee</hi> her ſting; but loſe our labour; and, as <hi>Paul</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians, are leſſe beloued;</hi> the which makes vs to cry, <hi>my ſighes are many, and my heart is heauie.</hi> But loue God, and thou ſhalt be beloued; for in this loue is no loſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>He onely can giue vs content:</hi> For as the foote is neuer ſtable, till it be pitcht on firme Land; ſo our affections are euer wauering, vntill they be fixt on God; who is the firſt <hi>Being,</hi> the ſuſtainer of the ſoule.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Call to mind, how he hath loued vs:</hi> Shall he chooſe vs from eternity, and we reiect him in time? Nay, rather, let his loue to vs, worke in vs a reciprocall loue of him; and ſo it will, in all his choſen: let me but giue warmth, to my clothes and ſhall I not receiue heat, by way of reflexion?</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>He is alwaies with vs, in vs, and neither will, nor can be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from vs;</hi> What a griefe it is; experience tels, not to bee preſent with the thing beloued. This <hi>diuiſion,</hi> like <hi>Reubens, cauſeth many thoughts of heart.</hi> For perſonall preſence; when friends affect, aboue all things is deſired; and here onely, and no where elſe, it is to be obtained. Ne thinkes theſe thinges, ſhould like the Load ſtone yron; draw and knit our hearts vnto the Lord, were they well weighed. But if all this will not, let vs further conſider this, that, <hi>if he be not the obiect of our affection; we ſhall be the ſubiects of his eternall wrath and indignation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may ſuffice, to haue beene ſpoken of <hi>loue</hi> as it looketh towards God: now we will handle it, as it hath relation to man, where we obſerue, that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Children of God, loue one another.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>1. A man will cloth himſelfe: 2. Feede himſelfe. 3. Lodge himſelfe. 4. Prayſe God, and pray to God for himſelfe. 5. grow in, and gather grace for himſelfe. 6. And for heauen, he will daily prepare and fit himſelfe.</p>

Hee will not vrge and carowſe to make drunke himſelfe. 5. He will not ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſcredit himſelfe. 6. And laſtly, he will not goe to law and ſute with himſelfe.</p>

               <p>2. Then, if not, tell the caſe to two or three, to ſee if they can ende the controuerſie. 3.

               <p n="1">1. For order; Chriſt loued vs, before we loued him; for <hi>we loue him, becauſe he loued vs firſt;</hi> ſo ſhould wee loue our brother, before we be beloued of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. It muſt be in <hi>ſinceritie;</hi> that is, not in hypocriſie; or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation: our loue muſt be pure, not mixed, not in <hi>word, but indeed and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And we muſt haue regard to the <hi>degree of loue: Paul</hi> tels vs of <hi>the height, bredth, depth, and length of his loue,</hi> and this, will thus better appeare, in theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He being God became man, that by this his pouerty, wee might bee made rich:</hi> What a degree of humilitie was this?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He died for vs; and herein is the loue of Chriſt made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</hi> For <hi>greater loue than this, can no man ſhew, to lay downe his life for his friends;</hi> Nay, for vs, who were his <hi>enemies.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> loued vs <hi>without meaſure;</hi> for who can limit his loue, and ſay, <hi>hither came it, and no further?</hi> this is a great bredth.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p>Should we trie the loue of our dayes by the firſt rule, wee ſhall finde but little: if by the ſecond, much leſſe; for who clotheth his neighbours? may not many a member com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine with the head, <hi>they haue parted my rayment, and on my

But for preparing a place in heauen for his neighbour; let him be one of a <hi>thouſand,</hi> that mindes matters of that nature: ſo that wee may ſay true, <hi>loue</hi> in theſe dayes is litle and very cold: many cry they haue it, who neuer yet ſought to know it.</p>
               <p>And ſhall we once imagine, that they who quarrell and kill? robbe and ſteale? ſweare and forſweare? drinke and be drunke? ſlander and reproch? contend and goe to law, as the yong man, (if he lyed not) <hi>kept the Commandements</hi> from his youth vpward, that theſe loue their neighbours? Nay, doe they not hate themſelues? To all theſe I may ſay, how dwelleth the grace of loue in you? Such (wee heare ſay) haue learned all that the Preacher can teach them, viz. to loue God aboue all, and their neighbours as themſelues; when as they are without naturall affection, and haue no ſparke of this grace in them. But were Chriſtians tryed by the ſecond rule; that is <hi>to loue one another as Chriſt hath loued vs;</hi> we might cry out, <hi>helpe Lord, there is not ſuch a man left:</hi> for we will not loue, where we are beloued; our loue is for goods, not for doing others good; and if we haue any of this water ſhed abroad in our <hi>hearts,</hi> Oh! how is it mixed with mudde? truely, our loue is ſhort and ſhallow, weake and often interrupted. It is hardly kindled: ſoone quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; beginnes with a flame, but ſuddenly ends in ſmoke and ſmother. We haue little fewell, much quench-coale; a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:972:105"/> drop of water, will extinguiſh our loue; a ſmall puffe, will put it out. Our affections are like a lime-twigge; to day, they catch a fowle; tomorrow they will not hold, the ſofteſt lighteſt feathers; ſo that <hi>in my haſt, I had almoſt ſaid; all men are liers,</hi> who ſay, they haue it; for, theres none that hath it; No, not one. Wee talke of it; and of <hi>profeſſors;</hi> but let our loue be weighed at this ballance, it will be found too light; and not many amongſt a million, to haue any of this fire on the hearth of their hearts for all their boaſting. Wherefore let vs try our ſelues, whether we be in the loue or no: for either we haue in poſſeſſion, or at the leaſt in reſolution, what hath beene ſaid, elſe, we want the <hi>loue of God and of man;</hi> Now, if thou finde it in thee, after due ſearch; bleſſe God for it; follow it, keepe it, and increaſe it ſtill. But if not, let theſe motiues following, induce thee to purſue it.</p>
               <p>1. He that <hi>loueth not his brother is a murtherer;</hi> and <hi>wee</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Motiues to loue one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</note> 
                  <hi>know that no murtherer hath eternall life, abiding in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We account murther a fearefull thing; why? all that loue<note place="margin">1 Io. 3. 15.</note> not as we haue ſaid, are guiltie of this foule ſinne, and one day ſhall be arraigned, and condemned for it.</p>
               <p>2. By loue thou maiſt try the truth of thy new birth; for he that loueth his brother is <hi>borne of God;</hi> and is not this worth the knowing? 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>3. Without this loue, thou art but a dead man, odious, in<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 9.</note> the eyes of God and man; <hi>he that loueth not his brother, is dead till now:</hi> who would bee dead, <hi>among the liuing?</hi> how nature abhorres it, we perceiue, when we view but the dead corpſe of our deereſt friend.</p>
               <p>4. Finally, <hi>loue will expell feare, and make a man bold againſt death, &amp; the day of iudgement.</hi> Why doe ſo many Chriſtians tremble and feare? why doe they ſhrinke and ſhudder at the remembrance of death! alas, they want loue either in truth or in degree; for <hi>perfect loue</hi> (like wind the chaffe) <hi>driueth away feare.</hi> And know this, that he who harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 4. 18.</note> hate in his heart, is often ſtruck with horrour: but hee who maketh <hi>loue his gueſt,</hi> is filled with boldneſſe. For hee that loueth his brother is Chriſts Diſciple, and hath a porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:972:106"/> in all the prayers of the Saints; what need then ſuch a man to feare? Then get loue, and forget not; and if thou doe but ouer-take it, at the day of thy death, it will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence all the paines, thou haſt tooke in thy life.</p>
               <p>And that thou maiſt loue thy brother, obſerue theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Baniſh ſelfe-loue out of thy heart:</hi> ſay vnto it, with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,<note place="margin">Directions for Loue.</note> 
                  <hi>get thee hence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Get a good vnderſtanding of the worth of a chriſtian:</hi> For knowledge of that, (like a <hi>Bee her ſting</hi>) will ſet on our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

               <p n="4">4. And laſt of all, conſider that Chriſt comes to thee, and is in <hi>thy poore brother: a Balaam</hi> will not beate his beaſt, if once he perceiue, <hi>the Angell of the Lord to be in him,</hi> &amp; ſpeake by him.</p>
               <p>More might we adde, as 1. Labour to <hi>be vnited with Chriſt grafted into him;</hi> ſo ſhalt thou be <hi>like minded,</hi> and receiue of his fulneſſe, <hi>grace for grace, affection for affection.</hi> 2. Striue alſo <hi>to loue God:</hi> For as a greater circle comprehends the leſſer; ſo doth the loue of him, the loue of all his children.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing finiſhed our diſcourſe of <hi>loue,</hi> we come to ſpeake of a <hi>ſound minde.</hi> And out of the diuerſe readings, or ſeuerall interpretations, we may deriue a double doctrine firſt, that,</p>

               <p>In the laſt place, let all, who would be reputed Chriſtians get ſound mindes; be not like <hi>children, but men of ripe age.</hi> Are not men without this, compared to fooles; <hi>madde</hi> and frantike perſons?

When theſe return to their wits, like the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> will they not be aſhamed? what doe ſuch but abuſe the beſt things, to the diſhonour of God and their owne damnation? wherefore, get knowledge, ſtriue for a ſound minde; for <hi>men of vnderſtanding, are of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpirits.</hi> And for our furtherance herein, wee will ſet downe, what a ſound mind is; and wherein it conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſound minde, is the minde guided by the arte of Logicke;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A ſound mind defined.</note> that is, <hi>the true rules of Reaſon.</hi> For euery good Logician hath a <hi>ſound minde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God hath giuen to man Reaſon, which is the verie eie of the ſoule; and to guide this reaſon, hee hath appointed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, the which if he follow, hee ſhall <hi>doe well.</hi> For, as it were to no purpoſe, to haue an eye, if he had no obiect for it; ſo in vaine to haue reaſon, wanted he rules to guide it. And God hauing made man, and all things for man, hath giuen him an eye to ſee them, and how by rule to diſpoſe of them. And this muſt be noted; that the rule of Reaſon,<note place="margin">Note.</note> croſſe not the precepts of <hi>Divinitie;</hi> for they will ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, though ſomethings in <hi>Divinitie</hi> goe beyond our reaſonable apprehenſion. For in the word of God, there is, 1. <hi>Truth 2. Goodneſſe.</hi> Truth is the obiect of reaſon; Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the obiect of the will; hence, the will is more noble, than the vnderſtanding from the goodnes of its obiect.</p>
               <p>And for our better proceeding in this wee haue in hand,<note place="margin">A diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> we may conſider a <hi>ſound minde;</hi> 1. In it <hi>ſelfe;</hi> or 2. In reſpect of its <hi>obiect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All things in the world may be ſaid to be, primarily the obiect of <hi>Reaſon:</hi> for as the eye hath all creatures &amp; colours viſible, for his obiect: ſo all arts, or the irradiations that proceed from them, firſt reflect on the glaſſe of mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or vnderſtanding. And as the eye guides the hand, ſo reaſon guides the will. The eie, in order of naturall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, directeth the foote and the finger; the eie of reaſon, in morall actions, guideth affection, and the wills faculty. And as the hand and foote guided by a dimme eye, doe often
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:972:107"/> worke and moue a miſſe; ſo the will and affection, miſled by the darkneſſe of reaſon, operate and doe things not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Intelligence;</hi> which is, that act of reaſon, whereby<note place="margin" type="runSum">1.</note> we vnderſtand <hi>euery particular concerning euery thing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Science;</hi> which is that act of reaſon, whereby, we <hi>know all truth in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Sapience;</hi> which is, that act of reaſon, whereby<note place="margin" type="runSum">3.</note> we <hi>vnderſtand and perceiue, what will follow from euery thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Prudence;</hi> which is, that act of reaſon, whereby<note place="margin" type="runSum">4.</note> we obſerue <hi>the fitteſt opportunities for the effecting of all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>Art or Skill;</hi> which is that act of reaſon, whereby,<note place="margin" type="runSum">5.</note> we <hi>know how to effect euery thing moſt skilfully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or, the firſt act of reaſon, is to ſee ſimple arguments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any relation one to another. The ſecond act, how one depends on another, as cauſe and effect, abſolutely; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and adiunct after a manner. The third act, is diſcerning of what will follow, as the deduction of axiomes. The fourth act is, to apprehend how theſe are to be applyed in vſe. And the laſt act is skill, how to diſpoſe of all aright. For he that doth the foure firſt, is an artiſt and a skilfull artiſt; ſo that wee ſee what is needefull for a ſound minde.</p>
               <p>But yet we would not enſnare the tender conſcience here, as though without this acute knowledge none could be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; we rather doe deliuer this doctrine, that, man ſeeing his blindneſſe might be truly humbled, and not boaſt, as many doe, of their iudgements, that <hi>know nothing as they ought to know;</hi> and conſequently, ſeeke vnto God for wiſedome, who giueth it to the ſimple for ſaluation. And there is no good Chriſtian but hath, in ſome meaſure, a <hi>ſound minde;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 15.</note> for <hi>the ſpirituall man diſcerneth all things:</hi> and Chriſt hath promiſed to <hi>ſend them his ſpirit, which ſhall leade them into all</hi>

               <p>And now we will a litle touch the obiect of a ſound<note place="margin">The obiect of a ſound minde.</note> minde, and ſo winde both vp together. And to theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular heads it may be referred. 1. Logick. 2. Grammar. 3. Rhetoricke. 4. Geometrie. 5. Arithmeticke. 6. Philoſophie and 7. Diuinitie.</p>
               <p>The art of Logicke, guideth <hi>Reaſon:</hi> Grammar and Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, ſpeech: Geometrie and Arithmeticke, quantitie, both diſcrete and continued: Philoſophie, nature; and Diuinity the will. And a man may be ſaid to haue a ſound mind, that is skilfull in any of theſe arts. Further, that may not bee omitted, that Arts may be compared to the ſteps of a ladder; and as the loweſt guideth and helpeth to all vpwards, yet it ſelfe borroweth ayd from none; ſo doth Logicke giue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection &amp; helpe to all the other arts, yet it ſelfe receiueth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from none; and this is worth our learning to ſee, how one depends vpon another.</p>
               <p>God, he hath made all things liable to reaſon; and, that man might apprehend them, he hath tipt the creatures, as with colours for the eye, ſo with Logicall irradiations, for the vnderſtanding to receiue inſtruction. Now becauſe all things fall not vnder the act of one mans vnderſtanding; and in regard he is a communicable creature, and all things made for him; he hath appointed a poſt (for ſpeech is but the carriar of the truth to the perſon) that others might partake of all his wiſdome. Grammar, like one in a plaine<note place="margin">Mans meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers be 1. Loquentia. 2. Eloquentia.</note> ſute, deliuers the thing as it is, plainly: but Rhetorick, like a braue man in purple, or ſome cut, laced, or iagged ſute, brings it more plauſiblie. Thus good was God, to giue man variety of veſſels, that he, with the more delight might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the truth. And here you ſee how Logick prepares packes for Grammar &amp; Rhetoricke; which be as Carriars to travell with truth. Where note, that Logicke may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grammar; and they that bring ſpeech into Logicke,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:972:108"/> are in an errour, greatly deceiued.</p>
               <p>For Logicke hath not to deale with ſpeech, but is a diſtinct art; and ſpeech is but the veſſell by which from man to man, truth is conveied. Its true, that Logicke is in the words, but no otherwiſe than meate in a veſſell, as a common adiunct to it; not as the forme in the matter, which is an eſſentiall part of the thing. Now when Logicke, Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, and Rhetoricke haue done, comes in, Quantity: for if <hi>Reaſon</hi> find it out, &amp; Speech giue it nomination; it will be for quantitie, great or little; for number one or moe; &amp; here comes in the vſe of quantitie, diſcrete or continued. Thus fiue of the arts are paſſed. In the next place, Philoſophie ſteppes in, and tels you the nature of the thing, whether hot, cold, ſweete, or ſowre &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And finallie, Diuinitie like the higheſt ſteppe of a ladder, hauing borrowed helpe from all the others, comes in, laſt of all, and is the rule of goodneſſe. And as the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doth apprehend truth, and falſhood; ſo the will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth good or euill. But euill comes in by accident, and is not any part of the wills proper obiect; no more than falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the vnderſtandings obiect, except the vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be firſt deceiued; and ſo the will embrace it as good (though euill) in appearance. And now from all this that<note place="margin">Concluſions from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> hath beene ſaid, we might draw many excellent concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

               <p>Thus we come, in the next place, to ſpeake of moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in perſonall iniuries; Wherein thou muſt be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:972:111"/> for we loue our ſelues very well. Doe men ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, or write againſt thee? avoyd thou all bitternes, and immoderate courſes: Raſhnes and heate in this caſe (as I haue eſpecially obſerued in ſome mens writings) hath done, a good cauſe, harme: ſay with <hi>Michael</hi> avoiding ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<note place="margin">Iud 9.</note> words; <hi>The Lord rebuke thee;</hi> or with <hi>Paul.

               <p>I might follow this point further, in reſpect of outward things; but a word of all in generall. Take heed how thou letteſt thy affections looſe, they be nimble birds, quicke ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and not eaſily recalled. Let them not light and ſit long of any ſtand, either perſon, or thing; for they will with the more difficulty be remoued. When men ſet them on, (as the Bee doth her ſting, or the Cripple leane on his Crut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) with all their ſtrength; then, when the thing they affect is tooke away, they fall vpon all foure, and are foully be mudded: Set them on, as Citizens doe their Maſtique patches on their faces, or as we put gloues on our hands; ſo will there neither be paine, or peril in the remotion of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or doe, as he doth by his feete, that ſtandeth on the quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, remoue them often, by withdrawing the minde from them; ſo when the tyde of trouble approacheth, thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as his feete, will not ſticke faſt, but, without danger thou maiſt plucke them vp, and be gone. The true cauſe, why the beſt men haue beene ſo turmoyld in croſſes, hath beene the immoderate affection, of earthly &amp; moueable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. In concluſion avoyde all counterfeite moderation, for<note place="margin">Caution.</note> its as bad as immoderate affection; and be thou aſſured, that if thou vſe either, at one time or other, it ſhal wound the heart, peirce deepe into the ſoule, and coſt thee full deare.

                  <hi>Be not therefore.</hi>] This word, <hi>therefore,</hi> preſuppoſeth two things. 1. An inference drawne from ſome precedent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. 2. A thing to be omitted, or performed, ſubſequent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſhamed.</hi>] Shame is an effect that followeth the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome evill; and alwayes is a companion of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: But by not being aſhamed, <hi>Paul</hi> intendeth more, as Boldnes, reſolution, conſtancy, perſeuerance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the teſtimony of our Lord.</hi>] That is, the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and it may be called his Teſtimony, for 2. Reaſons. 1. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſeale it with his bloud. 2. Becauſe in the Goſpel, teſtimony is giuen of Chriſt. Teſtimonies are either divine, or humane: they be inarteficiall arguments, hauing little force of arguing, or prouing a thing; and that they borrow from the artificiall; for they haue it not in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Now the Goſpel is a divine teſtimony, and hath great power and authority, becauſe the author of it, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was trueth it ſelfe; and they that penned it, were carried by the Spirit, and could not erre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither of me his priſoner.</hi>] There be two ſorts of priſons and priſoners; ſpirituall, or corporall; of ſpirits, or of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of ſpirits in priſon: where note by the<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 19.</note> way, that ſoules departed are in place, contrary to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome. But here is meant a corporall or perſonall priſoner; for ſo was <hi>Paul</hi> at that preſent. And he ioynes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe his cauſe was coupled with <hi>Chriſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Exhortation followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But be partaker of the afflictions of the Goſpel;</hi> or, <hi>Doe thou ſuffer together for the Goſpel.</hi>] This word, <hi>Partaker,</hi> intimates, 2. things, 1. Companions, or diuers perſons. 2. A thing devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or ſhared amongſt them. The perſons, Companions to <hi>Timotheus,</hi> was <hi>Paul</hi> and others; the thing they had part of, was <hi>afflictions.</hi> And afflictions are ſuch as either wound the ſoule, or body; for man conſiſting of a double ſubſtance, may ſuffer two kinds of torments: But man onely can hurt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:972:113"/> the body; not the ſoule of <hi>Paul</hi> was in their fingers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the Goſpell.] Goſpel</hi> in Greeke is glad tydings; and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſome deriue of God and <hi>ſpeech,</hi> ſaying it is an old Saxon word, ſignifying Gods ſpeech, or good ſpeech. The ſenſe is, Endure ſuch troubles as accompany the Preachers and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracers of the word of God, and of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to the power of God</hi>] There is ſome difficulty in the vnderſtanding of this phraſe; and my Authors ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to content me. Some vnderſtand them thus: <hi>Being moued by, or with the power of God;</hi> others reade; <hi>Being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the Goſpel, which is according to the power of God;</hi> that is, in which the power of God doth plainly ſhew and declare it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>For my part I take this to be the truth; that <hi>Paul</hi> wold haue <hi>Timotheus</hi> to ſuffer as he was able, and had, or ſhould receiue ability from God. And hee ſeemes to anſwere a ſecret ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, that might ariſe in his ſonnes heart. He might thus reaſon: How am I able, being yong and weake, to endure ſuch great troubles as accompany <hi>Paul,</hi> and other ſtrong Chriſtians? <hi>Paul</hi> takes away this, thus: Why <hi>Timothy,</hi> doe thou ſuffer according to thy power; beare what thou art able; for that's all I require of thee, or that the Lord will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict thee withall.</p>

               <p>It is not any vpſtart and fantaſticall, but an auncient and an Apoſtolicall kind and way of teaching. When <hi>Paul</hi> by many Reaſons had proued the Reſurrection and iudgement to come; in concluſion hee makes vſe. <hi>Wherefore, my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,</hi>

And <hi>Peter</hi> treadeth in the ſame ſteps of method. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. And you ſhall find it practiſed throughout the booke of God. For (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle) <hi>Seing theſe things are ſo, what manner of men ought we to be, in holines of life and blameleſnes of converſation? 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
               <p>For is it not reaſonable? Who can deny it? wee gather<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> ſome note that directly floweth from the Text; then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it. Firſt, By axiomaticall propoſitions; and Secondly, By ſome third argument. When two pieces of cloth be in controuerſie, we take a light, and by that wee diſcerne whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the better, for colour, ſubſtance: ſo when two things are controuerted, which of them is the truth, wee produce a third argument, and laying that to them, as the candle to the cloth, wee come to iudge the better which is falſe, or true.</p>
               <p>And Application is profitable: For men naturally, being<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> vnwilling to receiue the ſeed of the word, as the hard earth is the corne, Application, like a mallet or harrow, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the heart, and cauſeth the truth to take the better, and deeper impreſſion.</p>
               <p>Men therfore muſt not condemne this Method as though<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1. Obiect. Sol.</note> it were vnreaſonable, vnprofitable. But ſome may ſay, The Scripture doth not vſe it, I anſwere, it doth; yet not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly:
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:972:114"/> for God in wiſedome and goodnes, hath ſcattered things, and often vſeth an inverſion of the parts, that man might ſeeke &amp; ſearch in the vſe of his Reaſons. For Logickes Rules are like ſo many hounds, beating the buſh of Gods booke, to find out the truth. And as flowers, were they layd vpon an heape, would not be ſo delightfull to the gatherer, as when in the garden, they be pluckt here and there by one and one. So the truth in Gods Booke, being found out by ſeeking and ſearching, here a little, and there a little, is much more acceptable and well pleaſing vnto man. And this (I iudge) is the Reaſon; why the Scripture is writ as an hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>This may confirme and encourage thoſe; that vſe this<note place="margin" type="runSum">

Notwithſtanding we tye no man to our order; but let euery one write and ſpeake, as he hath receiued of the Lord. Yet this I adde, that it is good for memory, &amp; the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe profit the moſt by that way of teaching: therefore its not amiſſe for their better edification, to deſcend and ſtoope to the capacities of the ſimple, vnlearned.</p>
               <p>And this, by experience, I haue proued, that the doctrine<note place="margin">Directions in the deduction and applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of doctrines.</note> and my text (if rightly deduced) make a Syllogiſme; the text it ſelfe alwaies being the third argument to confirme it.

And laſt of all, my vſe and doctrine muſt be alſo a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme, and ordinarily a connexe; ſo that ſo many vſes as you deduce from the doctrine, if they will (the doctrine being the third argument) make a ſyllogiſme; you neuer miſſe your rule, be they few, or many.</p>

Chriſt will haue his chiefeſt Champions to fight the greateſt combates; weake ſouldiers ſhall come in the Rereward, and not in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, or in the heate of the battell. And be ſure of this, that if thy ſtrength be encreaſed, thy troubles ſhall be alſo aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;<note place="margin">Note.</note> for all our graces, in truth and in degree too, ſhall be employed: If Chriſt be infinite in power, hee muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the infinite wrath of his father being made a ſinner by imputation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if God dealeth thus with vs, let vs haue the<note place="margin" type="runSum">

A miniſter muſt hauean eye to diſcerne the ſtate of his flocke, and put a difference in his commands; he muſt not tyre the Lambes with driving them too faſt, or too farre, with the elder Sheepe. Choyſe muſt be made to faſt and pray, and to performe extraordinary duties, at extraordinary times, lawfully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, lawfully to be executed.

Chriſt would not haue ſome to ſpeake of him, and to tell of his workes: why? for they were not, for the preſent, either able to defend the truth, ſuffer for it; or thoſe with whom they were to deale, fitted to receiue it. We haue many, but too forward in theſe times, except their ability were better; yong Chriſtians will be (now a dayes,) in the heate of the skirmiſh, without a calling, caſting Cannons off their carriages, that neuer gaue fire to a double Muskert, controll the Captaines; when as they themſelues neuer fought on foote. Yet beare, fight, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, but know thy ſtanding, thy ſtrength; and preſume not (like <hi>Peter</hi>) aboue thy power.</p>
               <p>For our direction; we muſt know, that ability is either<note place="margin">Power diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted.</note> inward, or outward, Inward. 1. Spirituall. 2. Corporall. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is in our head Chriſt or our riches: And according to all this power we muſt beare and ſuffer. Some Chriſtians, like great bony beggars, are able to beare much; but in the time of trouble, they either run away, or ſhrinke when the burden is to be put vnder their ſhoulders: others (as wee haue heard) thinke nothing too heauy for them: ſo that theſe are extremities on both hands, and to be, as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, avoyded.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And called.</hi>] Calling may be diſtinguiſhed. 1. By the meanes, and 2. By the ſubiects of it. The inſtruments, are either principall or ſecondary. God is the chiefe efficient of our calling; and the Miniſter, word, and creatures are but as inſtruments in the workemans hand. The ſubiect is man onely; and that either generall, or particular: Generall, as whole Nations; Gentiles, Iewes: Particular, as perſons; <hi>Paul, Timotheus;</hi> the latter here meant.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, calling is either effectuall; or not effectuall; for we may diſtinguiſh of it according to the ſucceſſe.</p>

So God is called <hi>holy.</hi> Yea, he is holines it ſelfe. Perſonall holines is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inherent, or actuall; and both theſe are to bee found in the ſubiects of this calling, though not perfectly, yet in ſome degree.

And as our ſinnes were made his ſinnes, and hee became a ſinner by imputation: ſo his holines is made ours, and we without ſinne by imputation. Finally, holines is aſcribed to the word, to the Sabbath, and many other things; becauſe they are cauſes of holines, or times wherein we are ſpecially commanded to ſerue God in the duties of the firſt table, or in that the things be not applyed to a common vſe; and in ſome one of theſe ſenſes or other (as wee ſhall heare more anone) this calling is ſaid to be holy.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5.</note> in Scripture for this purpoſe. 1. Chriſt is compared to a vine; the faithfull to his branches. 2.

And who ſhall ſtop the courſe of this riuer? <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 14. Rent this tree vp by the rootes? <hi>Io.</hi> 15. Bruiſe this head? <hi>Io.</hi> 1. 18.

               <p>Finally, if they ſhould not be ſaued, what great abſurdities<note place="margin" type="runSum">

He is in the naturall (I ſay not legall) Genealogie of Chriſt, and no doubt, but Chriſt would giue him that honour, as to ſaue him. 5. Hee might not commit idolatry, but permit his Concubines; ſo his ſin was the leſſer; for as he was ſaid to build the Temple by others; ſo might he be reputed an idolater in bearing with others. 6. He was a ſpeciall type of Chriſt; and all this being thus, who dares conclude, that hee was condemned? We may boldly, avouch the contrary.</p>

               <p>In this cutting off, we may obſerue, 1. The time when,<note place="margin">What time the Lord calleth.</note> and 2. The manner how. The time is ordinarily, when wee are the beſt able to doe the Lord ſervice in his vineyard, which is, in a middle age: ſeldome are children, and rarely be old men called: for the one is not of age to worke, the other, almoſt, paſt age to worke. Yet we read of ſome chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as <hi>Ieremiah, Ioſiah, Timothy,</hi> and others, that of children were called; that Parents might be encouraged to vſe the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:972:128"/> meanes of converſion, and not be without all hope of a bleſſing: And ſo we doe of ſome old men, as of <hi>Abraham</hi> called at 70 yeares of age: and it ſeemeth probable by <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodemus</hi> his anſwere to Chriſt, that he himſelfe was an old man. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. This, no doubt, is written, that we might not<note place="margin">Aged perſons rarely called.</note> deſpaire of any; for God can call whomſoeuer, and whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he will. Yet men and women of great age are not often called 1. For they are moſt vnfit for the Lords worke: what man will take an aged perſon to make a watch, or to become a Muſition? for are not his fingers ſet; which ſhould bee nimble for ſuch a calling? how vnhandſomely will they goe about ſo curious an inſtrument, or action? And ſhall the Lord then, not make choiſe of the fitteſt perſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his actions? 2. Old men haue gotten a ſtronger ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of ſinne then others: what ſaith Chriſt of ſuch? <hi>Can a Blackamore change his skin, and a Leopard his ſpotts? then may ye doe well, that are accuſtomed to doe evill.</hi> 3. Sathan hath more poſſeſſion of ſuch people, and is the harder to be caſt out. 4. We read in the Goſpell, that God calles at the third houre, ſixt houre, ninth and eleuenth houre: why not at the twelfe, making an equall diſtribution? I cannot tell, I doe but gueſle; but it may be, becauſe at the twelfth, houre, either none, or few are called. I would not be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here, as though this were vnpoſſible with God: but that men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might be moued not to procraſtinate and deferre their conuerſion, I haue added this.

This for the time of calling.</p>
               <p>The manner how, followeth; and that is, either violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">How the Lord calleth.</note> or more gently. God is wiſe in all his proceedings, and therefore calleth, as he ſeeth needfull: Some he peirceth to the very hart, woundeth the ſpirit, &amp; cauſeth them to quake and tremble exceedingly at the voice, of his power: others he calleth with a ſtill and quiet voice as is moſt conuenient. The diſcreet Mother hauing a child ſtubborne &amp; vntoward
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:972:128"/> ſhaketh the rod; when as one, that is more meeke and tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table is allured by a cherry or apple; and euen ſo dealeth the Lord by his choſen children; for he calleth them according to their diſpoſitions and ſeuerall qualities, yet alwaies ſo, as they come and obey his voice.</p>

               <p>When the Cyon is cut off from the tree, then in order it followeth, that it be fitted to be ſet into the ſtocke, into which it is to be graſted: And ſo, when by the knife of the law, we are either violently, or more leiſurely lopped from the old oliue; it enſueth that wee be fitted to be ſet into the new, Chriſt the Lord. Now this compunction of heart hath two degrees; the one rendeth aſunder the very ioynts and ſinewes; pierceth and entreth into the very bones, and the marrow.

               <p>And after this compunction followeth an holy deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which conſiſteth in the denying of a mans owne merits and relying on the Lord for mercy: for his ſinnes being great and many, his good workes not any at all, he is therby brought to deſpaire in regard of himſelfe, and alſo to call the mercy of God into queſtion: Yet not doubting whether the Lord can, but whether he will or not, grant him a pardon for his ſinne. Now doth the ſinner hang the head, ſmite his hand vpon his thigh, cry earneſtly to God for mercy, and ſeeke to the Miniſter, the Phiſition of the ſpirit, for grace and comfort. And this compunction and holy deſperation is greater in ſome, then other, for theſe Reaſons.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Other ſome haue had good education, and haue bin trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp in the Scriptures of children; ſo that they haue beene reſtrained from many groſſer ſinnes, then others haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Whence it followeth, that there is degrees of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction: Trees that haue beene long vnpruned, haue the more cuts, when they come to be lopped and dreſſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Peraduenture, the Lord hath a purpoſe to ſend ſome one of his children, for to dwell, like <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom;</hi> or <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and there he foreſeeing, that they ſhall haue weake provocations to good, ſtrong temptations to evill, letteth them drinke the more deepely of the dregs of ſinne, that they, in future time the rather may be moued to avoyd it: For a wounded ſpirit, and troubled conſcience for ſinne, will proue, for time to come; an excellent Tutor. Hee that hath burnt his feete with treading on the hot ſtone, will looke the better to his ſteps, in all his iourney afterward.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All men haue not conſtitutions of body alike; ſome be ſtrong, others weake; ſo that, that meaſure which will but cure the one, humble him ſufficiently, would kill the other and bruiſe him to powder. And if ſome were ſo caſt downe as others be, they being poore men, and to liue by great toyle, and dayly labour, would neuer be able to execute the duties of their calling, and to get their bread by the workes of their hands. A man in the breaking of his beaſt, will haue an eye to that; and ſhall not the Lord much more in the reclaiming of his children?</p>
               <p n="5">5. God appointeth ſome to be ſonnes of thunder, to ſpeake with power and authoritie, to Preach amongſt a people, whoſe faces be as braſſe, and neckes like ſinewes of yron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; therefore he bringeth them home (as we ſay) with a witnes, at their conuerſion: For as he that hath receiued much wrong by a bad neighbour, will ſpeake worſe of him, then he can, who hath had leſſer iniuries at his hand: ſo will
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:972:129"/> ſuch, as haue felt the enmity of ſinne the moſt, preach more fervently againſt it, then he who hath not felt the ſting of it, in that meaſure.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Finally, ſome men haue moſt excellent and acute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; now the more clearely the intellect receiueth a fearefull obiect, the more will the heart be troubled. If one, through the dimnes of the eye, take a Lyon for a tame beaſt, he wil not be ſhaken with equall terrour, as he wil, that by the clearenes of his ſight diſcerneth the beaſt in his owne kind and nature. And this is a moſt true poſition, that the beſt wits, be the moſt wounded in heart, at their effectuall calling; becauſe ſin and the puniſhment be the more cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehended: and men (ordinarily) more then women, from the acutenes of the vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>But ſome may obiect; Its from God, not man, that one is<note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p>True: yet the Lord worketh according to the condition<note place="margin" type="runSum">Sol.</note> of the ſubiect, about which he is excerciſed.</p>
               <p>And women are often more caſt downe, then men be, at<note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p>Thus you haue heard, how the Lord prepareth a ſinner, before effectuall vocation, cutting off and fitting of him to be grafted a new; at which time, he is like a branch ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now hee giueth Chriſt to him, and him vnto Chriſt, ſo that the penitent perſon is come home into his deſired place, and the liberty of Gods children.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:972:130"/>
               <p>Now from this that hath beene ſaid, we may deduce ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin" type="runSum">Concluſions from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> things for our further inſtruction, and to confirme vs concerning the certainty of our effectuall vocation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here we ſee, that the law is neceſſary to be preached, that, like a ſchoolemaſter, it may whip vs to Chriſt, for to find comfort in the time of neede.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the true ſight of our ſinnes and humiliation is a companion of effectuall vocation; for the ſicke haue need of the Phiſition; and Chriſt calleth none, but ſuch as are loſt in their preſent apprehenſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That euery ſigh for ſinne, and compunction of ſpirit is not to be effectually called: for Reprobates, like <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> may, for a time, be much deiected; yet neuer receiue Chriſt, whereby to be truly iuſtified.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We learne from hence, that effectuall vocation is an action, ſenſibly to be felt by the perſons, who be the proper ſubiects of it; and a worke, though, on Gods part, ſecretly effected; yet on mans, eaſily apprehended.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And here men that haue not endured ſo much humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation as others, yet are not to deſpaire of their ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for the Lord doth not call all his a like. To one hee reveileth ſome little ſinne at the firſt, leaſt he ſhould be ſwallowed vp of overmuch heauines; yet by the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof he commeth to coniecture, what is due vnto him for the reſt: And when the poore ſinner hath got pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againſt this, then he will reveale vnto him ſome other of greater nature: for hauing had experience of Gods former mercy, he is made the more bold and able for to wreſtle with greater tranſgreſſions, and Sathans more fell and fierce temptations, the which vſually come in the latter end of this ſpirituall combate; For like a cunning Captaine, that would raze downe the walls, he firſt diſchargeth his leſſer pieces, and if they will not effect it, then he giueth fire to his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Ordinances, and roaring Cannons.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And for concluſion, let him that is neuer ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected not be out of heart, as though the Lord could not raiſe thee vp againe, and comfort thy ſoule; for as his mercy, ſo

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> For firſt, Circumciſion was removed, which was full of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it made <hi>Zipporah</hi> to call <hi>Moſes, bloudy husband;</hi> yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Exod. 4. 25.</note> be ſo ignorant, that they know not this priviledge. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The Ceremonies and ſacrifices which were charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able were aboliſhed: we haue the body in ſtead of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; the ſubſtance for the circumſtance. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiled<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 9.</note> them <hi>beggerly and impotent rudiments.</hi> And if we muſt not come into the Temples, but bring our Lambs and Rams, we then would ſee the priviledge we enioy. Thirdly, The Iewes, before his comming, were in great ſlauery: the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans gouerned by 70. Elders; the Scepter was departed from <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the Phariſees had corrupted their doctrine: <hi>Herod</hi> ſought the babes life, for feare a King ſhould riſe vp to the Iewes of the family of <hi>David;</hi> and they had heauie burdens impoſed vpon them, the which they were not able to beare. Fourthly, Chriſt came of their fleſh, and was not that an honour? For many deſired children, and eſteemed it a curſe to be barren vnder the law; becauſe each one ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to haue beene the Mother of our Lord. And did he not firſt preach to that Nation? wrought miracles amongſt them, and doe many great workes there? Now his firſt fruits were to be reſpected.<note place="margin" type="runSum">

               </p>
               <p>And ſecondly in reſpect of the Gentiles, it was more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; for Firſt, They were dogs before; but now God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded <hi>Iapheth</hi> to dwell in <hi>Shems</hi> tent. God was both the God of Iewes and Gentiles at this ſeaſon. Secondly, The Apoſtles had diuers tongues to preach to them; <hi>Paul</hi> was their Apoſtle; many of them converted; the Wiſe men were<note place="margin">Math. 2. 9.</note> the firſt fruits; And the Goſpell was writ in their Dialect.

               <p>And finally, greater grace was giuen after Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:972:138"/> then before him. Therefore the Temple Prophecied<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note> of in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> was bigger then in the dayes of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Its true that ſome particular perſons were rare and excellent vnder<note place="margin">Iſai. 6. 8. &amp;c.</note> the law; but if we looke at whole Churches, they then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them, vnder the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>This ſerueth to confute thoſe, that of late are ſprung vp,<note place="margin" type="runSum">

Why <hi>Abraham</hi> deſired to ſee our dayes? why the ſecond Temple was more glorious then the firſt, wanting many things that the other had? why <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt was the greateſt of all the Prophets, yet the leaſt vnder the Goſpell greater then he?

               <p>They will ſay, that Chriſt was truly, and as plainly ſeene<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiect.</note> vnder the Law, in the ſacrifices; as now vnder the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>

               <p>For the firſt kind; notwithſtanding all the great meanes which they enioy, yet to ſee to, they are very beaſts.

Its fearefull to liue in ignorance; but how farre greater damnation are theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of, ſeeing light is come into the world, and they loue darkneſſe more then light? Shall it not be eaſier for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Capernaum</hi> in the day of iudgement then for theſe? Haue we not ſome, that deny the Lord that bought them? tread vnder foote the bloud of the new couenant, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie againe the Lord of Life? Witneſſe our ſwearing, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, and drinkings; our whoredomes, fornications, and all manner of wickedneſſes. Doe not ſome count it their grace to appeare graceleſſe? glory in their faithleſnes? ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent their words with vaine phraſe, &amp; make the beginning &amp; Concluſion of their ſentences to be nothing elſe but an oath? It were tolerable for men (if at any time) to ſtumble in the night; but to drinke, ſtagger and fall in the day, is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.

               <p>And I may not omit thoſe of the better ſort, who take not (as they ought) notice of Gods providence over vs in theſe latter daies.

Doth hee not run his circular motion ſtill? and haue not many a poore ſoule paſſed through the darke night of this wildernes, to the fruitfull and cleare ſhining day in the land of <hi>Canaan?</hi> Wherefore prayſe God for that you haue; and pray often and earneſtly, that the Sunne of the Goſpell may neuer ſet, or the Candle of the word be put out, ſo long as the Sunne and Moone endure. Be not like <hi>Rahel,</hi> crying for your wills, as ſhe did for children, or elſe ye dy. And be not offended to heare me ſpeake a word more; Repine not, murmur not, and fret not at that Manna you haue; for many haue fed well of as courſe and little food, looked fat, faire and well liking, and reſted contented with leſſe then an Homer full: For Gods power is alwaies the more ſeene in weake meanes, then ſtronger.

When trees are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued to a more fertile ſoyle, doe we not expect, that they ſhould ſpread further, and be more fruitfull then before? when cattell are put into a better paſture, will we not looke for greater growth, more labour at their hands? Shall not we then grow ſtrong, worke mightily in the Lords vineyard, and reſolutely run the wayes of his commands? Is not our light brighter, our ſpirituall food better, and our iourney ſhorter? then why is there not ſome equall proportion? Brethen, theſe things muſt be thought vpon, made vſe of, or elſe our account one day will be the greater, the heauier: for vnto whom much is giuen, ſhall much be required.

Yet to me, it ſeemes to be otherwiſe. For though it be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true in the two former reſpects, yet, the laſt is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>1. Death is a meere priuation, and therefore being nothing cannot produce by way of cauſation, any perfect effect.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:972:143"/>
               <p n="1">1. Death is a meere priuation, and therefoer being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, cannot produce by way of cauſation, any perfect effect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The death of Chriſt was a curſe, therefore cauſeth good by accident, not of its owne nature. Whereby the way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſee an other errour to be in thoſe, who hold, that Chriſts death without his actiue obedience is abſolutely ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our iuſtification. But the ſucceeding arguments may ſerue to confirme the contrarie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That obedience which the law requireth is neceſſarie for our iuſtification. But the law requireth actiue obedience; therefore actiue obedience is neceſſarie for our iuſtification. The former propoſition, I ſuppoſe will be granted; neither can the latter vpon any good ground be denied. Becauſe the iuſtice of the Law is ſtill inforce, time not changing the nature of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That obedience which was to haue iuſtified man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall, is requiſite to iuſtifie him being fallen. But actiue obedience was to haue iuſtified man before his fall. Therefore actiue obedience is requiſite to iuſtifie him being fallen. What can be obiected againſt this argument, for the preſent, I perceiue not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That obedience, which <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth to his owne righteouſnes, which was of the law, concurreth to our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. But the actiue obedience of Chriſt, <hi>Paul</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to his owne righteouſneſſe, which was of the Law. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. Therefore, the actiue obedience of Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth to our iuſtification. For, who euer commenting on that text, excludeth Chriſts actiue obedience? And to ſay the truth, paſſiue obedience is rather a ſatisfying of the threat, than a fulfilling of the lawes precept.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the actuall breach of the Law made man vniuſt, then the actuall obſeruation of it, muſt make him righteous. But the actuall breach made him vniuſt; therefore the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all obſeruation of the law muſt make him righteous. Except we ſhould maintaine, that our ſurety Chriſt, was bound onely to pay the forfeiture, and not the principall, which
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:972:144"/> may not be admitted. For, man after his fall incurred a doubled debt, both which Chriſt was to diſcharge, elſe hee had not ſatisfied, the full payment to God our creditor. And doth not actiue obedience the one, as paſſiue the other? Its death that muſt remoue death, life that muſt procure life. For, contrary effects muſt haue contrary cauſes, ſuch as life and death be. A ſharp powder, or water, may eate off the thicke filme, that couereth the eye, and hindereth ſight, but there is another internall principle is the cauſe of ſeeing. In like manner, the death of Chriſt, may remoue what hindereth life. Yet there muſt be another primarie cauſe, for the procuring and conſeruing of it. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, Chriſt, in ſuffering, obeyed; and in obeying, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Wherefore, what God hath ioyned together, let no man renta ſunder.</p>
               <p>And if death, through Chriſt, be aboliſhed, and by no<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 4.</note> other, then deaths deſtruction was no eaſie action. For, who but he, could haue done it? If it had bin to haue bin aboliſhed by another, ſhall wee thinke then, that the father would not haue ſpared his onely ſonne?</p>
               <p>But you may demand; Could not God haue ſaued man<note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> from death and pardoned ſinne, without a ſatisfaction?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; No. For, 1. Its againſt his nature, Iuſtice in God<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſ.</note> is not a quality as in man, but his verie eſſence, therefore it muſt be ſatisfied, or no fleſh could be ſaued.</p>
               <p>2. His word was paſſed forth. <hi>At what time thou eateſt, thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi> Yet the Lord ſheweth the liberty of his iuſtice, in ſauing ſome by Chriſt, and condemning others without him.</p>
               <p>So that we ſee ſinne muſt be puniſhed, Gods infinite iuſtice ſatisfied, either in vs, or by another.</p>
               <p>But it will be obiected, that man being finite cannot ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for infinite iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Its true, that man is finite, in reſpect of place, or a geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall quantity, but infinite, in regard of duration of time, or <hi>Arithimetical</hi> enumeration; ſo that though no created na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, at an inſtant in one act, of it ſelfe, is able to vndergoe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:972:144"/> the infinite wrath of the reuenging God, yet in regard of continuance, or times ſucceſſion, his torment may be ſaid to be <note n="*" place="margin">Viz a parte poſt.</note> infinite. What he cannot doe at once, hee muſt be doing euer.</p>
               <p>How can God be iuſt in this his proceeding?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe man hath offended an infinite God. Now, the<note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt. Anſ.</note> dignitie of the perſon offended, aggrauates the offence; as, we ſee, a word againſt the king is death, to a ſubiect, pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſinner hath had a world of ſinning here, therfore muſt haue a world of ſuffering hereafter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſinner ſinnes continually, neuer comes to a period; therefore, the puniſhment, as the ſhadow doth the body, when the Sunne ſhines, followes the ſinner continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>And 4. The ſinner would haue ſinned in a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, had it beene in his owne power, or if he had not beene by a neceſſity reſtrained. Therefore, its iuſt with the Lord, to puniſh him; with eternall torments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And brought life</hi>] We haue handled the like doctrine in<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 7.</note> the firſt verſe, that ariſeth out of this place; viz. that, <hi>All ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life is procured by Chriſt.</hi> Therefore, we paſſe to this,<note place="margin" type="runSum">

For when the ſpirit ſauingly applyeth to the Chriſtian, the vertue of Chriſts death, theſe forenamed effects or properties will be in ſome meaſure felt in that perſon.</p>
               <p>And wouldſt thou alſo know, whether life be by Chriſt<note place="margin">Trials if we haue life by Chriſt Ieſus.</note> procured for thee? then examine thy ſelfe by theſe rules.</p>
               <p>1. What knowledge haſt thou of Chriſt? what vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Goſpell? For, its eternall life to know Chriſt, and his doctriue. <hi>Hagar</hi> had her eyes opened, before ſhee could ſee the well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo muſt thou the eye of thy minde, before thou taſt of the water of life.</p>
               <p>2. What power haſt thou to do good: How often doth the pulſe of prayer beate in thy cloſet, and in the ſecret roome of thy heart? What ſtrength haſt thou to runne the pathes of Gods commands? Canſt thou like the creeple, riſe vp, leape and be glad in the praiſes of God?</p>
               <p>5. What care haſt thou to preſerue the life of grace in thee, and to come to eternall glorie? Men that loue their liues will make choyce of their food, Phyſician, and aire: And he that loues the life of grace, will eate vp the good word of God, depend on a skilfull Preacher, and plant himſelfe, where the pure ayre of holineſſe is ſenſible found and felt breathing, mouing.</p>
               <p>4. And in concluſion, how doſt thou imploy thy life? what be the ends of all thy motions? Doſt thou ſpend thy ſtrength, that God may haue glory by thee, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren receiue good from thee? then thou haſt done well. For, as all fire that comes from aboue, will tend vpward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, &amp; the heate that comes from the heart will diſperſe it ſelfe to euerie member; ſo that life which is receiued from Chriſt will alwaies incline, and moue, that hee may haue praiſe and benefit by it. Are theſe things alſo within thee, and proceed from thee? then haſt thou participated of the firſt reſurrection, and <hi>ſhalt neuer taſt of the ſecond death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if thou want them, ſtriue for them, or elſe Chriſts
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:972:145"/> life will profit thee nothing. See thou defer no time, omit no oppertunitie, neither neglect any meanes: but ſeeke this life while it may be found; purchaſe this field, though it coſt thee all thy treaſure. Thou <hi>haſt now a price in thy hand, want not an heart.</hi> For, the tyde and ſeaſon to ſaile to this land, to buy this commoditie, ſerues but once, not euer. And to moue thee, thus to doe, let theſe things be well weighed, ſeriouſly thought on.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider the excellencie of this life; the leaſt degree of<note place="margin">Motiues to get ſpirituall life.</note> it, is of more worth, than all other life what euer; therefore its called the <hi>life of God. Eph.</hi> 4. 18. How many kindes of life be there? and amongſt them how many degrees? yet the neerer it approcheth to the fountaine of life, <hi>God,</hi> the more excellent it is. The ſubiect hath a life aſwell as the King, the ſicke as the whole; but what is it in compariſon of this, but a kind of death? now, the better a thing is, is it not the more to be deſired?</p>
               <p n="2">2 Without this life, we can doe no action acceptable to God, or profitable to our ſelues; and what a miſery is this alwaies to be doing, yet all in vaine? A naturall life can doe but naturall actions; therefore <hi>ſuch as be in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God. Rom.</hi> 8. 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This life will make vs acceptable, and well pleaſing to God and man; yea, the Angels ſhall reioyce, and the father ſay with delight, <hi>This my ſonne was dead, but is now aliue. Luk.</hi> 15. 24. We ioy to ſee the trees budde, the corne peepe, the graftes flouriſh, and ſhall we haue no care to obtaine that life, wherein all beautie conſiſteth?</p>
               <p n="4">4 Finally, he that hath not the beginning of this life here, cannot poſſeſſe eternall life hereafter; for they onely ſhall eſcape <hi>the ſecond death, that partake of the firſt reſurrection, to life.</hi> The couetous; when he hath gotten goods; the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall hauing ſatiate his ſoule, with the huskes of pleaſures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ambitious, when he hath climbed to the higheſt pitch of honour, thinke they liue the onely Iouiall life, and yet all dwell and breathe in the chambers of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) <hi>are dead, while they be aliue;</hi> no better than
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:972:146"/> walking ghoſts in the formes of liuing men. Let ſuch buy and build, plow and ſow, marry and beget many children, yet the <hi>vntimelie birth is better than they.</hi> The baſeſt life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes as much the beſt meere being, as <hi>Adam,</hi> the red earth, whereon his body was made; but this life excels all others (Gods only excepted) more than men do beaſts, or Angels Deuils. Why then let the worth of it moue thee; the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of this is worſe than the death of the Gourd of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah.</hi> And will not this conſideration, that all thy actions are but as ſo many beautifull ſinnes, and diſtaſtfull vnto the Lord, ſet thee a worke to obtaine it? Then call to mind how it maketh all things beautifull, and well pleaſing to the eye. Will not our fleſh tremble to ſee a body without a ſoule, the teeth cloſed, the eyes open, the lips ſhrunke, and the bloud ſet, blacke and ſwart in the face and members? is not ſuch an obiect odious to man? Euen ſo, yea worſe are we being dead in ſinne, to God and good perſons. Yet, if all thats ſaid, will not moue thee to this; then know, <hi>No life here, no eſcape of death hereafter.</hi>

               <p>And know this; that to Preach the Goſpell is to Preach<note place="margin">Math. 11. 28.</note> ſalvation only by Chriſt Ieſus; and to ſuch as be weary and heavy laden: Papiſts doe not the firſt; many omit the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

               <p>And at the firſt, in the dayes of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. ours was of the latter kind; (And <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily called, yet did no miracles.) And that the calling of our Miniſters in thoſe times was extraordinary, its evident. For 1. they had extraordinary gifts. 2. Extraordinary cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. 3. Extraordinary ſucceſſe; for in a ſhort time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great oppoſition, how farre was the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſcattered? Sathan fell from heauen, at their preaching, like lightening, ſuddenly, ſpeedily. And 4. in this, their calling will appeare to be extraordinary, that they (after ſo many ages paſt) ſtood vp being but a few, againſt the great ſinnes of that time.

               <p>And if Reading were more excellent, and of greater force to convert, then Preaching, why are not the people conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that haue a Reader?

               <p>Yet obſerue this, that one thing may be for diuers ends; as the Redemption of man by Chriſt, was not ſolely for the good of man, but for his owne, and the glory of his father; and Chriſt as he was God, was both the end, and the meanes; ſo that ſometimes things be not as they ſeeme to be.</p>
               <p>I will to and fro diſpute the queſtion no longer; for my firſt generall anſwere ſhall ſtand for all; And none needs to doubt of the truth of it, Onely, thus let vs conclude, that as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Giue that to Caeſar, which is Caeſars, and to God, that which is is Gods:</hi> So giue we to preaching that which is its due, and to prayer its priviledge alſo.</p>

And did the world thus deale with him, who had no ſinne, neither was any guile found in his mouth? then neuer expect thou any good entertainment from the world, in this world; for ſhee loueth none but her owne. Shall men burne greene boughes, and ſpare thoſe that neuer beare? ſpue out the water of life, and taſt deepely of the muddy puddle? Eclipſe the Sun, and not puffe at a candle?

               <p n="1">1. Hath he not fed thee, clothed thee, lodged thee, ſince he gaue thee a being? and is his hand ſhortened, and not ſtretched out ſtill? When the Diſciples of Chriſt were troubled in minde about theſe matters: <hi>What?</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>haue ye not remembrance, how I fed you with a little bread and a few fiſhes? When I ſent you forth without money in your purſe, meate in your ſcrippes,</hi> and all other prouiſion, <hi>wanted you any thing? they anſwered, No Lord.</hi> When a poore man hath beene alwayes, in his want, relieued by his rich friend, will it not make him the more boldly to rely on him for helpe in time to come?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider how he hath giuen thee knowledge, when thou waſt ignorant; infuſed faith into thine heart, being before an infidell; and preſerued his graces in thee from periſhing. For the calling to minde the dayes of old is a notable helpe for this thing. Is it poſſible that he who hath begun to doe well, will now waxe weary in ſo doing? What man planteth a tree, and will not labour to preſerue the

Call to minde the many dangers from the which he hath deliuered thee: Why mighteſt not thou haue beene buried in thy Mothers wombe, beene drowned in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or deuoured on the land? the theefe might haue ſlaine thee, ſome crumbe choaked thee, or a thouſand diſeaſes beene thy death. And ſhall not the freſh remembrance of theſe things worke powerfully in thee? When our Apoſtle had beene deliuered out of the mouth of the Lyon, he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered ſtrength thence, that <hi>the Lord would deliuer him from euery evill worke, and preſerue him vnto his heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 17. 18.</p>
               <p>III. Take a view how, in times paſt, he hath dealt with his children; run to and fro, through the ſtories and acts of holy Writ; and as he hath done to his ſervants of olde, ſo will he doe to thee, aſſuredly. I wiſh that this were well thought on; for its a notable remedie. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 25.</p>
               <p>IV. Conferre with grounded Chriſtians. Demand of them, how the Lord hath dealt with them, in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; for they can teach thee by experience; their comforts will comfort thee alſo. A timerous patient will be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſwallow the bittereſt pill, when another ſtandeth by, that hath beene cured of the like diſeaſe, that he now is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with, telleth him the experiment.</p>
               <p>V. Take a view of the vanitie of all other things: (<hi>Our</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>fathers ate Manna in the wilderneſſe and are dead.</hi>) For in ſo doing, thou ſhalt get experience of Gods conſtancy: the Creature is changeable; ſometimes killing, another whiles curing; But the Lord is one and the ſame for euer.</p>
               <p>VI. Finally, and aboue all, Conſider how the Lord dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with thee in the vſe of all his ordinances: Marke what power the Word hath in working in thy ſoule: how it weakeneth corruption, ſtrengtheneth the new man: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue how the Lord hath heard thy prayer in time paſt, and now how he enableth thee to call vpon him, being in the

                     </gap> my prayer;</hi> and therefore, as one refreſhed, biddeth the workers of iniquitie, be gone. Canſt thou pray at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as in times paſt, when he heard the voyce of thy weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? then doubt not, but he will deale fauourably with thee: For when the Lord intendeth to conferre a fauour vpon his children, he will alwayes giue them hearts for to vſe the meanes, whereby he doth ordinarily, convey the ſame vnto them, and wherevnto he hath annexed his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. If <hi>Hannah</hi> prevaile for a ſonne, or <hi>Abraham</hi> either, they ſhall firſt be enabled a long ſeaſon to powre out their ſoules by prayer vnto the Lord. And ſo it is in all other things whatſoeuer. I wiſh that every one had but the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of this engrauen in their mindes; for it would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for them every manner of way. And true it is, that this experimentall knowledge of God, is the very food and ſpirit and life of a Chriſtian, from which all faith, patience, and reſolution in the times of trouble, ſpring and flow, as from their proper fountaine and roote: Then ſtriue for it in the vſe of the forenamed meanes; and when thou haſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, wonderfull and vnſpeakeable are the effects, that it will produce, and thou ſhalt taſte of.</p>
               <p>Againe, in theſe words, wee ſee <hi>Paul</hi> placeth knowledge before beliefe; whence we may collect this doctrine, that</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Becauſe the act of faith in beleeuing followeth the act of the vnderſtanding rightly guided. Knowledge is like the needle, which maketh the way: faith the threed, that tyeth and vniteth things together.

                  </gap>ir ridiculous fables; we read of one that was ſicke, his ſtomacke would vomit vp whatſoeuer he receiued; ſo that he being willing to receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet doubting he ſhould not retaine it, if he receiued it by ordinary courſe; it was put (the conſecrated Hoſte, I meane) to his ſide, the which opened, and after the receipt thereof, cloſed as before.</p>
               <p>And there is mention made of a woman, whoſe Bees were ſicke of the Murraine, who tooke alſo an Hoſte, put it into the hiue, and (marke this) they within a few dayes were not onely cured of the danger of the diſeaſe, but there was a miraculous encreaſe of them in number; and they had built a Chappell, and ſteeple, and bells, and an Altar, and layd the Hoſte thereon; and the Bees ſung their Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call houres about it (iuſt) as the Monkes vſe to doe in their Cloyſters.</p>
               <p>I could relate the like of the Lady of <hi>Loretto:</hi> (for ther's bookes of her too in <hi>Folio.</hi>) Its reported that ſhee ſometime (vnderſtand the houſe too) being diſcontented, diſplaced her ſelfe, and paſſing by a wood, all the trees, in reuerence, bended and ſtooped, with their heads to the very earth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her; (wonder it was, they had not rent themſelues vp by the rootes, and proffered her their ſtandings).</p>
               <p>Alſo the Booke ſayth, that one, being priſoner in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> and there having his bowells ript out, by the ayde of a

               <p>Many more ſuch as this the Bookes mention. And doe ye not now eaſily beleeue that theſe things are harder to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, being related, then if in groſſe or implicitely, they had beene vttered? I may ſay of theſe, as a man replied once, hearing a ſtrange tale, that he gaue ſmall credit to; and the Relater demanding ſaid, <hi>Why ſir, doe you not beleeue this?</hi> the perſon replied; truely, its too much for one to credit it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but if the perſons preſent will take my part, we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it amongſt vs. And I thinke the Miracles in the three Bookes of the Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> and their Legend, are too many and too great for any one <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in the world, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue knowledge of them, to beleeue them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will leaue the ignorant <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who never read or heard them, to giue credit to them. I ſpeake not theſe things (miſtake me not) to moue laughter; but to make them (if poſſible) aſhamed of their doctrine; and that we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ſeeing their moſt palpable blindneſſe and error, might be the rather induced to prayſe God for our light, and the truth we pertake of.</p>
               <p>But to omit them and their falſe Doctrine: Let vs come<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2.</note> nearer home, and learne what to iudge of ſuch as haue no knowledge of God at all; Why ſurely they haue no faith in him neither: for the Lord hath put theſe together, like man and wife, and therefore they may not be put aſunder. Chriſt propounds this Queſtion, <hi>When the ſonne of man</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>ſhall come ſhall he finde faith on the earth?</hi> From the vſe of this Doctrine we may make anſwere; Surely very little; For if knowledge be but amongſt few (as that is a truth) then is faith rarely to be found.</p>

               <p n="1">1. In his power, how that he is able to doe whatſoever he<note place="margin">How God is to be knowne.</note> will: this confirmed <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and moved him to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his ſonne, to whom it was ſaid, <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeede be called; For he conſidered, that God was able, even to raiſe him vp from the dead.</hi> Heb. 11. 18. 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt know him in his truth and iuſtice. This made the Apoſtle to be of great courage in his perilous voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and <hi>Sarah</hi> to expect a ſonne, after ſhe was paſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall courſe of conceiuing, <hi>becauſe ſhee iudged him faithfull which had promiſed.</hi> Heb. 11. 11.

And if we were more acquainted with this, it would ſtrengthen our faith in the performance of all his promiſes to vs; and the many threats giuen out againſt the wicked.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are to know God in his ſtabilitie. How that time changeth not his nature, neither altereth his purpoſe; He had no beginning, therfore cannot either be yong, or grow old. He conſiſteth not of either matter or forme; but is one moſt ſimple and pure act; ſo that he is not incident to any ſhadow of turning. What the Lord hath ſaid, it ſhall<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> ſtand for euer, for God is not like man, that he ſhould repent or change his purpoſe. Did we know this, it would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſupport our weake faith, and ſtay our ſtaggering mindes. Did we vnderſtand that the affection of our friend, we moſt affect, were conſtant, it would make vs the more confidently to rely on him. But feare of mutation, weakens perſwaſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are to vnderſtand, that God is ſoveraigne Lord,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:972:164"/> that there is none higher then he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if we ſhould truſt in an inferiour, we might be deceiued. But know this, that he is aboue all, and then thy faith cannot faile thee in beleeuing in him. To put confidence in an inferiour Lord were dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in policie; but in Divinitie deſperate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We muſt know God in Chriſt; For without him he is a ſevere Iudge, a conſuming fire: But if we know him in Chriſt Ieſus, he is our Father, and all his attributes, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would be terrible, will be moſt comfortable. Thinke on this.</p>
               <p>Finally, We are alſo to know God in the diſtinction of Perſons: One Deitie, yet three ſubſiſtences, Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt; and we ſhould haue ſome apprehenſion of their ſeuerall operations: For otherwiſe we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue as we ſhould, and ought, for his full glory, and our certaine ſalvation.</p>
               <p>And thus briefely I haue poynted out ſome things in God, and of God, that muſt be knowne, if we would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Faith to the eternall conſervation of our ſoules.</p>

Vſe makes perfect; a good habit is hardly got, So not eaſily loſt: For he that hath vſed to commit his ſoule to God in the times of peace, ſhall with eaſe doe it in time of danger. Yea let ſuch a man but dreame of death or drowning, in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſleepe, his mind will reflect it ſelfe on the Lord, and he run vnto him for perſervation. Grounded Chriſtians know the truth of this by experience. And in Concluſion, know; that the oftener we commit our ſoules vnto God, and draw the neerer him in this duty, why, let death come, how and when, and where it can or ſhall come, we ſhall feare it the leſſer or any euill; but embrace it, entertaine it, ſhutting vp the eyes of our bodies with the which our minds now ſee God, as through a paire of ſpectacles, and more clearely and comfortably behold him with the naked eye of our ſpirits.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

Yet this Caution is to be had, that the definition be true, conſiſting of the eſſentiall cauſes, and not of the effects or adjuncts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God cannot cauſe, that a ſubiect ſhould exiſt without its eſſentiall properties. <hi>Exa.</hi> As that a man ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the faculty of ſpeaking or laughing; fire, without heate: And though theſe doe not conſtitute the eſſence of the ſubiect, yet they be ſo neerely and firmely knit to it, yea, doe ſo immediately flow from it, that without them the ſubiect cannot exiſt no not for a moment. For we are to know. that more belongs to the actuall exiſtence of a thing, then are required to the ſimple eſſence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God cannot cauſe that oppoſites ſhould be attributed to one and the ſame, if ſo that all the conditions of oppoſites

               <p n="4">4.

But they extend the power of God, too farre, not conſidering that they argue not from a <hi>poſſe ad eſſe,</hi> but from an impoſſible thing to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>And this alſo refuteth the error of thoſe, who reaſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iudgment from an impoſſiblity of being to a being; as though this or that be true, becauſe God can doe beyond our apprehenſion. But God cannot contradict (as we haue ſaid) his owne nature, or the truth of things.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, it will follow from the definition, that God can doe more then he hath or will doe: He could haue raiſed vp children to <hi>Abraham</hi> of ſtones; Chriſt could haue called for Legions of Angels; but would not. <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 9. &amp; 26. 53. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18.

And a man may be ſaid to nill what he doth not will. But we leaue this to the moſt learned to iudge of.</p>

                  <hi>Goodnes</hi> may be conſidered, either <hi>firſt,</hi> or <hi>from a firſt.</hi> The former is in God, and indeed very good; ſo that he willeth himſelfe neceſſarily and primarily; becauſe he is the chiefeſt good; and this may be ſaid to be an internall, not an externall action; for ſo the acts of Gods will are diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted. The latter is, whatſoever proceedeth from God; and this good is of two kindes, either of nature, or grace; and his Will is converſant about them both, as its proper, (though ſecondary) obiect.</p>

               <p>The reaſon I ſtand to proue this, is, in that thoſe who hold that Chriſts actiue and paſſiue obedience doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre both of them to mans iuſtification, ſeeke to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that <hi>Adam</hi> had no law in him or out of him to guide him, except the trees of life and death, good and euill. But certainly, this is a farre fetcht ſhift, and as farre from the truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the trees were as Sacraments to ſeale life or death, vpon the breach or obſeruation of the law, as ours be.<note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. Sathan was ſubtile and tempted <hi>Adam</hi> to breake the kings ſeale, for that ſpoiled all the reſt. And the blotting out of a word or ſentence is not ſo great an offence in any deed, or writing, as to deſtroy, ſpoile, and abuſe the ſeale.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Why</hi> did God giue the tables in ſtone afterwards if man
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:972:175"/> was not to be guided by them in his creation? Was he then bound to God and his brother, and not before? or did God make a new law? or ſet <hi>Adams</hi> ſonnes a taske, their father neuer had?</p>
               <p>But we let this paſſe, and proceed to giue further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the point in hand.</p>
               <p>Againe, the naturall powers of man are much weakened,<note place="margin" type="runSum">

But (more is the pittie) we liue without rule, caſt the patterne behind our backes, and doe the moſt of our deeds at randon. For what patterne haue we to worſhip Idoles? to ſerue God after our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions? to take the Lords name in vaine, toſſing it like the tenniſe? to profane the Lords day? diſobey authority? to kill and murder? to commit fornication and all vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? to cozen, filch and ſteale? to equivocate, lye, and beare falſe witneſſe?

               <p>1. It may be called new, in regard man had forgot it. 2. In<note place="margin" type="runSum">Sol.</note> reſpect it was renewed by Chriſt: otherwiſe it was the ſame from the beginning. For Chriſt <hi>came, not to aboliſh the law, but to perfect it.</hi> And we vſe to call a ſute new, when its but renewed: And hath not diuinitie the ſame ſcope as at the firſt?</p>
               <p>But they had none; or one contrarie to ours, before the<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2.</note> law was giuen by <hi>Moſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:972:176"/>
               <p>Neither: For 1. They had a rule, and the ſame that was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward giuen by <hi>Moſes.</hi> For, they did deliuer it to their children, and ſo by tradition it was continued. <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 19.</p>
               <p>2. The diuerſe deliuery of the ſame thing doth not alter the nature of it. For whether I ſing or ſpeake a thing, its the ſame, though the action differ. Whether I write in parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or paper; engraue in wood or ſtone; this is but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution from the ſubiects, when that I haue writ or engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is the ſame: So the law deliuered by the immediate motions of the ſpirit, by <hi>Moſes</hi> preaching of it, or written in ſtone, or mans heart, is the ſelfe ſame and no other. Indeed, we haue it more perfect in Gods booke, than that engrauen in our inward parts. For, mans conſcience though compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a booke, yet its an imperfect writing, like ſome bookes that here and there want a leafe, a line in a leafe, a word in a line, or a letter in a word, ſo that its an imperfect rule.</p>
               <p>For if we had 2. patterns, they are either equall or vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall;<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> if equall, then one would ſerue, for its but the ſame; if not equall, then the beſt is to be followed: For in all things, we are (in Gods ſeruice) to couet <hi>the beſt things. 1 Cor. 12. vlt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are to aime at one end; therefore to be guided by one<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Phil. 3. 16.</note> patterne. This Reaſon the Apoſtle giueth. For <hi>vs proceed by one Rule, that we may minde one thing.</hi> Let diuers rules produce diuers effects: As if 2. Carpenters worke by a ſeuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall frame; or 2. painters draw after contrary patternes; will not the effects differ?</p>
               <p>If diuers patternes, then vnequall obedience; and ſo God<note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p>And all men were made by one Rule, therefore to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 4.</note> by one rule; for otherwiſe they ſhould ſwerue from the end of their creation.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, Are Kings, ſubiects; Maſters, ſeruants;<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiect.</note> Parents, children, to be guided by one patterne?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that they are, and they are not. As a King, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,<note place="margin" type="runSum">

                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:972:177"/> Maſter, ſeruant &amp;c, are Chriſtians, they are all guided<note place="margin" type="runSum">Sol.</note> by one rule. For by the ſame way that the poore be iuſtified<note place="margin" type="runSum">1.</note> before God, the Princes be, and no other: The water will drowne, and the fire burne Kings, aſwell as beggars: So will God both alike, if they come not cloathed with the wedding garment.</p>
               <p>All Kings, ſubiects; Maſters, ſeruants; Parents, children;<note place="margin" type="runSum">2.</note> as they be Kings, ſubiects, Maſters, &amp;c, are to be guided by the ſame patterne: So are Miniſters, as they be Miniſters; <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle and <hi>Peter</hi> &amp;c, had but one Rule, as they were Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>But if we conſider them in their particular orders, and<note place="margin" type="runSum">3.</note> ſubordinations, then the King is guided by one, and the ſubiect by another. For there be diuers callings, and one ſubordinated by God vnto another; therefore ſeuerall pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes preſcribed for them. Hence is that precept; <hi>Let euery</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 20. Rom. 12. 4. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>man abide in that calling wherein he was called,</hi> and the Lord placed him: For as all the members in the body <hi>haue not one office,</hi> ſo all the members of Chriſt haue not one calling.</p>
               <p>This doctrine meetes with many Heretikes, errors, and<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1.</note> hereſies in our daies. 1. With the Friers; why are not all guided by one patterne? they are all Friers; therefore as Friers but one patterne. For tell me; haue not all Logicians to diſpute by, if they truly doe diſpute, one patterne? euery Grammarian and Rhetorician the ſame patterne to ſpeake by? and ſo of all other Artiſts whateuer? Why then haue not this Rabble the like? But I will ſend theſe to lack vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands tale in <hi>Chaucer,</hi> for further confutation.</p>
               <p>And 2. it meeteth with the errors and hereſies of others; viz. ſuch as thinke it lawfull to allow a Toleration of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; that Papiſtry and Proteſtancy may eaſily be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; that men of any Religion may be ſaued; that great men are not bound ſo ſtrictly to ſerue God as the poore; and many other of the like nature. But let thoſe looke into Gods booke, and the truth of this doctrine, and they may eaſily ſee their wandrings.</p>
               <p>Here it would alſo thirdly refuce the Anabaptiſts, who
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:972:177"/> thinke all men may be Preachers, all things ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, all perſons are equall But we haue no ſuch patterne in the word of God; except Cautions be exhibited, the which by them are denyed.</p>
               <p>And this Doctrine is of generall vſe to all. Wouldeſt thou<note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p>Further obſerve, that the breach of the firſt precept in the firſt Table, is in reſpect of the obiect: the breach of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond precept in the firſt Table, is in regard of the Rule: the third in circumſtance, or manner: and the fourth in time. It will be ſaid that time is a circumſtance, therefore a breach<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiect. Sol.</note> of the third precept. I anſwere; 1. That time, though an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct, yet tis eſſentiall to an action: for no action can be done, but in time, ſhorter, or longer; And take away time, all created things would ceaſe. For time is an affection that runneth through and meaſureth all things, God onely excepted, who was from eternity.

                  </gap>ls one of the ſeuen were not a Sabbath, which they defend muſt be. For take the laſt of the ſeuen, and the firſt of the ſeuen, then one of the ſeuen is ſtill (though chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) a Sabbath. Therefore Chriſt would die the ſixth day, that he might reſt all the Iewes Sabbath, which ſeemes to be typicall. Now if the Iewes Sabbath ended at euen, then ours muſt begin, or elſe one of the ſeuen were not a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; but part of the eight and ninth &amp;c. and the Remnant added to one, or conſidered it ſelfe alone, would ouerthrow the firſt order appointed of dayes.</p>

               <p n="4">4. They argue, that its the moſt agreeable to Reaſon. For firſt if the Sabbath begin in the euening, then we know whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to begin it diſtinctly, when to end. Secondly, We may the better be fitted for it; for ſome, who hold it begins in the morning, toyle late that night, and ſo are then more vnable to ſanctifie the day. Thirdly, Wicked men are moſt prone to deferre the time, rather then to redeeme it; and what ſuch affect, we are to ſuſpect. Fourthly, If we begin the Sabbath in the euening, then we leaue the obiect of our particular calling behind vs, and haue one ſimple ſubiect of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate worſhip of our generall calling in the eye of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; the which is the moſt agreeable to reaſon, breeds leaſt diſtraction, and is moſt comfortable: ſo if at the Sun-ſet we end our Sabbath, we may talke &amp; diſpoſe of the duties of our particular calling for the morning following; riſe betimes without danger of the breach of the Lords day, the which will not be ſo conuenient, if it begin at any other inſtant, in reſpect of the forenamed particulars.

               <p>Loue hath foure principall properties.<note place="margin">Properties of loue.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It will make vs goe ſpeedily about good duties; how did the women run to the graue? <hi>Sichem</hi> make haſte to be circumciſed? And Chriſt raiſe vp <hi>Lazarus</hi> quickly? and Loue conſtrained them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Loue will endure ſorrow. Chriſt, through loue, layd
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:972:182"/> downe his life for vs: the Apoſtles for their brethren; it ſuffereth all things. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Loue ſeeketh revenge: <hi>Shall he make our Siſter a Whore?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 34. 31.</note> And it will breake a good heart by taking revenge on it ſelfe, for offending ſo good a God, ſo mercifull a Father.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Finally, Loue with godly ſorrow will make the man of God pine away. <hi>Amnon</hi> did thus for the loue of <hi>Thamar;</hi> and we muſt know, that true Loue hath the like, yea ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger operations. In a word, Loue will produce admirable effects; of patience, bountifulneſſe, long-ſuffering, and paſſing by of great and many wrongs and iniuries: So that no Loue, no obſervation of the patterne.</p>
               <p>And here we ſee that men without Faith and Loue can<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1.</note> doe nothing, that is good before <hi>God. Paul</hi> deſired to be kept out of the hands of men without faith; for he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them <hi>vnreaſonable and evill.</hi> 2 Theſ. 3. 2.</p>
               <p>Would we then practiſe the Apoſtles doctrine? then let<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2.</note> vs ſtriue for <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>loue:</hi> theſe two ſupport the eſtate of a Chriſtian, as the two pillars did the houſe of the Philiſtims; if theſe be removed, the foundation of our obedience and ſalvation faile and fall. Faith and Loue include all the duties of the Conenants of grace; and all the Commandements are reduced to Loue: for at the beginning wee were created<note place="margin">Note.</note> in Loue; the breach of the Law ſet all enmity; ſo the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it produceth amitie; hence Loue is ſtiled, <hi>The bond of perfection.</hi> Many boaſt of their great faith, but wee may ſay of their Loue, as <hi>Lot</hi> did of <hi>Zoar,</hi> that it is a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle one; for who of Loue to God eſcheweth euill, and doth good? or of affection to man, paſſeth by a fault, and is libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall? He that would ſoare to heauen wanting either of theſe, may aſſoone ſee a bird mount on high, and take her ſtand, who wanteth one wing. Faith, like the hand, taketh hold on <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and Loue, like the feete, muſt carry vs to him.</p>
               <p>And amongſt many other duties, What a fearfull thing is it to come to the Lords Supper without faith or affection to God and man. We will not come at the earneſt invitement of an enemy to his Table for feare of danger or diſlike: Yet
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:972:183"/> when we are haters of God, and our neighbours too, liuing in malice and enuie, hatefull and hating one another, wee ſtay not our ſteppes. But doe not ſuch perſons eare their owne iudgement? For they want that wherewith they ſhould feed truly on Chriſt, or giue them an appetite to this food, if they haue not affection and faith: for as the mouth and ſtomacke be to the body; ſo be Faith and Loue to the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt ſay, How may I know when an action is<note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> done in faith and loue.</p>
               <p>If it be done in faith. 1. Thou muſt be in the faith, that<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> What action is done in faith.</note> is, in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in thee. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. 2. It muſt be guided by the rule of faith. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. 3. It muſt be done with faith, not doubtingly. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. 4. And laſt of all, it muſt be done to the obiect of our faith. <hi>viz.</hi> in obedience to God in <hi>Christ,</hi> and for his glory. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
               <p>If an action be done in Loue. 1. Its done ſo freely, that<note place="margin">What in loue.</note> there is not the leaſt expectation of any future recompence. <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 15. 2. So ſecretly, that (if poſſible) none might<note place="margin">Math. 6. 2.</note> ever come to the knowledge thereof. 3. So cheerefully, as there is equall, (or rather greater) ioy in the doing, then<note place="margin">Ruth. 1. 13. 2 Cor. 9. 7. Philem. 10.</note> receiuing of the like fauour. 4. So affectionately, that the more good we doe to any, the more wee finde our hearts enflamed with the loue of that perſon. Theſe foure things accompany an action done in the truth of affection. For a good heart is conſtreined by loue; it will vpbraid no man; it knoweth that its better to giue, then to receiue; and it neuer waxeth weary or repenteth for well-doing. And there cannot be a ſurer ſigne of an heart ſprinkled with loue, then to reioyce, that it is willing and able to doe good to God or man.</p>

But men doe not thinke ſo, neither will they haue it ſo; yet the day of death, like an equall Ballance, ſhall declare it to be ſo.</p>

Wee make great ſtirre, before wee lay to pawne our chiefeſt Iewells; yet we let our faith goe freely, which is more worth then all. And it is to be feared, that God will ſeuerely correct this; or, we may doubt rather, that they, who doe thus, haue no faith or hope at all; for if they haue, they know the worth of it, and how they came by it: and (whatſoeuer many iudge) its not eaſily gotten. But ſuch play the Logicians, and make a diſtribution, ſaying, They ſweare but by their Ciuill faith, not by that which iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. I anſwere; firſt, that this diſtinction will not iuſtifie them. Againe, how ſhall a man know when they ſweare by their civill faith? Sure they ſound alike, therefore they muſt giue another accent, or tone; els they may, and others too, be miſtaken. But when will ſuch be wiſe? Is it not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter offence, to place the meaner and baſer thing and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Creators roome? Let them iudge.</p>

And to perſwade vs hereunto, Let's conſider to what they be likened. Grace is compared to fire, to water, to food, to ayre, and to gold and ſiluer. Is it not a miſery to want fire to warme vs, water to waſh and refreſh vs, food to nouriſh and to ſtrengthen vs, ayre to breath by, and to coole vs, and gold and ſiluer to enrich vs? We could not but thinke him a poore man, that a miſerable place, where all theſe be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and ſhall wee not ſee our owne woe, when we doe not enioy theſe things? All our ſacrifices are to be ſeaſoned with this ſalt, boyled in this liquor; roſted with this fire, if accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Chriſt, or profitable to his members: See then the worth of the one, by the want of the other. Haue wee not now time and meanes to furniſh our ſelues? But will this winde blow, this tyde returne, this fire deſcend, and this treaſure be got, when we expect it, deſire it? No ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Then take the oportunitie, leoſt the time come, and the evill dayes approach, wherein we ſhall ſay, that are haue no pleaſure in them.</p>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:972:186"/>
               <p>And let the rareneſſe too of this thing worke in vs ſome deſire to endeuour for it: For all men haue not grace and faith: its ſowne but in few Countries, and where it is, its not found growing in each mans grounds. Wee ſay, that things farre fetcht and deare bought, are the greateſt dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Why? doth not this treaſure come from farre? and what Ship could bring it to vs, except Chriſt the Lord? What could purchaſe and ranſome it, but the precious bloud of the Sonne of God?

And if the New man waxe pale, and pine away, the pathes of Gods commands will not be run or trodden.

               <p>We muſt then learne here, not onely to get grace, but to<note place="margin" type="runSum">

Shall <hi>Ionah</hi> be ſo dejected for his Gorud, and we neuer be moued, when grace is withered, ready to perſh? Shall the earth-worme ſigh at the loſſe of goods, and we neuer ſhrinke at the ſhipwracke of heauenly gifts? No grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter damage then this, none leſſe regarded, more inſenſible. Let our plants begin to prin, our haire waxe gray or fall, it will make ſome impreſſion: But grace may decay, the ſpirit faint, and few be wounded in heart.

               <p>Grace got, may be loſt: Elſe wherefore ſhould <hi>Paul</hi> bid his ſonne keepe the worthy things in his cuſtody? We giue the greateſt charge, when things are moſt ſubiect to perill, damage, or deſtruction. This poynt hath its proofe in holy writ. For did not <hi>Sampſon</hi> looſe his ſpirituall aſwell as, or rather then his corporall ſtrength and ſight? the ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his head, was the cutting and killing of grace in the heart; for by that, another thing is meant. The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> left, (though not totally loſt) <hi>her firſt love. David</hi> deſired to <hi>gather ſtrength.</hi> See <hi>Iudg. 16. Rev. 2. 4. Pſal. 39. vlt.</hi> &amp; 51.</p>
               <p>And this cometh to paſſe through our own negligence;<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> for when we doe not employ theſe talents to their proper ends, or watch ouer our ſelues, or neglect the meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them, or dig them in the earth, not vſing them at all; we ſhall either haue them remoued from vs, or, at
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:972:187"/> the leaſt, weakened in vs. Fire muſt haue fewell, or it will ceaſe to flame; infants are to be fed, or they will be feeble; And ſo muſt the babe of grace, the new borne child of faith, or fall into a fit of languiſhing.</p>
               <p>Againe, it may come to paſſe in reſpect of the Preachers,<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> and that of the bad, or better ſort: Falſe Teachers did creepe into the Church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and they fell from their former ſtedfaſtnes. And when ſuch as be truly ſent, preach rarely, coldly, negligently, and watch not ouer their flocke, much grace may be loſt by their default. Let the ſheepe faſt, or feed barely, they will grow lanke and leane of body.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Diuell cannot endure that grace ſhould grow,<note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p>Finally, the Lord may ſuffer it to be loſt (at the leaſt, for<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4.</note> a time in our owne feeling,) and that for theſe cauſes. 1. When we begin to ſwell, waxe big, and are puffed vp with his graces which ſhould humble vs. 2. When we are too ſeuere in cenſuring of our weake brethren. And 3. When we grow ingratefull to him, for the gifts he hath freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vpon vs. For God cannot endure pride, ſecurity, or ingratitude; therefore, he permits oftentimes, a winter, whereby, for a ſeaſon, theſe flowers looke dead and wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Wonder not then, if we ſee ſome backſliders in our<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 1.</note> times, as hath beene in former ages. For its no vnuſuall matter to finde declinings in this kind. And it's a diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble queſtion, whether any Chriſtian what euer (except hee depart ſoone after his conuerſion) doth grow and goe from ſtrength to ſtrength without ſome loſſe of the inward pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the graces wherewith he is endued? For Churches in generall, &amp; perſons in particular, haue had their ſymptomes, and diſtempers.</p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:972:187"/>
               <p>And this is to warne all men to watch the more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2.</note> ouer themſelues, that this languiſhing doe not befall them: As alſo to try themſelues, if they haue not fallen already from their former perfection, and left their firſt faith. And here two things may ſeeme needfull to bee propoſed. 1. How farre a man may fall and loſe his former gifts. 2. By what ſignes he may try, and know it.<note place="margin">How farre a man may fall from his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grace. 1 Sam. 26. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, we muſt vnderſtand that the gifts of God are either Common, or ſpeciall: Common belong to all men, elect, reprobate. The Reprobate may loſe thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall graces which they haue had, as we ſee in <hi>Saul.</hi> For its ſaid, <hi>The ſpirit</hi> (to wit, the gifts whereby he was to gouerne the Kingdome) was <hi>taken from him.</hi> The like may befall Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Elect themſelues may fall thus farre: 1. That they may call into queſtion, whether they euer had the grace of God, or not. 2. In ſo much as the Church, for a time, may ſuſpect the ſame alſo. 3. That they may neuer recouer their former eſtate, and doe the ſame workes they haue in time paſt, with that power, delight, conſtancie: And this ſeemes to haue beene the eſtate of <hi>Aſa.</hi> But theſe neuer fall totally or finally from the grace of God; And many times they come (but by much adoe) to their former condition, and are more ſtrong in the grace of God, then they were before their declinings: for experince hath taught them the worth of the gifts of the ſpirit, and what a miſery it is to the minde to haue her weapons weakened.</p>
               <p>Now for the ſecond, we may know our eſtate by theſe<note place="margin">Signes of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from grace.</note> ſignes. 1. When men begin to be idle, and neglect the duties of their particular callings; its a ſure ſymptome of the fall from grace. He that hath no deſire to worke or walke, but to caſt himſelfe on his couch, wrap himſelfe in the wollen garments, and there lyeth with his armes folden, his eyes ſhut, and his feete ſtretcht out, is either weake or lazie: ſo that man who is not
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:972:188"/> diligent in the diſcharge of his duty, is in a ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, or perilous lethargie.</p>
               <p>2. A man may perceiue it by his praying, and by nothing better: If thy prayers be cold, ſhort, and ſeldome, ſure thou art in a decaying eſtate. When men lie ſpeechleſſe, or be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſpeake, we then feare death will befall that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>3. If the publike meanes be omitted and neglected, it is dangerous alſo. For weake natures haue the worſt appetites. They that eate little, and deſlike their diet, cannot but be feeble perſons.</p>
               <p>4. When a man will not endure reproofe with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he is going backward. If <hi>Ionah</hi> tell the Lord, <hi>he doth well to be angry,</hi> his condition is not as it hath beene.</p>
               <p>5. Seuere cenſuring of others is not the ſecreteſt ſigne of this thing. For when our owne caſe is the worſe, we, vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, are moſt forward that way.</p>
               <p>Finally, if we make leſſe ſcruple of ſinne now, then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, this is fearefull. When <hi>David</hi> can ſheath his ſword in the bowells of his brother, that had in times paſt a ſmiting heart for touching of the lap of <hi>Saul's</hi> garment, his ſtrength is abated, and his grace weakened. Men in ſleepe digeſt the hardeſt thing; ſo thoſe that be in a ſpirituall ſlumber, concoct greater ſinnes, then in a day of waking.</p>
               <p>Now by theſe markes maiſt thou proue thy condition; wherefore if theſe things follow thee, know, that thou haſt not held faſt, that power of the ſpirit, thou hadſt at the firſt: ſo that it ſtands thee in hand to conſider from whence thou art fallen, to recouer thy former eſtate, and to doe thy firſt workes and better,</p>

               <p>To omit the diuers interpretations of that place, this I<note place="margin" type="runSum">Sol.</note> take to be the trueſt. Sathan is compared to a wayfaring man or traueller, who wandreth vp and downe the Moores and Marſhes to find water, yet when his hope is fruſtrate, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dry land, he then returneth to home his own habitation, the which is garniſhed to his minde: So the Deuill, when he cannot take poſſeſſion of other perſons, he, like a ſow, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes to his former muddy poole, and findeth it ſwept, but from all goodnes, therefore he reſteth there with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter content, then he had in his progreſſe.

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:972:191"/> ſo worthy a gueſt. How will we inuite and entreat to haue our good friend but a day, nay, one meale to be with vs? then ſhall we not vſe all the skill we can to poſſeſſe the Spirit of God, who will abide with vs and comfort vs at all<note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt.</note> times, in all conditions? Thou wilt ſay, Sir; by what way may I come to this thing? Why, thou muſt get a new heart:<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſ.</note> for he will neuer lodge in the old; for that's naught. And this heart muſt haue theſe properties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be broken, and that by the Law and the Goſpel.<note place="margin">Properties of a new heart. Luk. 18. 13.</note> The Law breakes the heart 2. Wayes. 1. In reuealing vnto man the number and greatnes of his ſinnes: ſo great an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement will pierce deepely. 2. By declaring what fearefull<note place="margin">Act. 2. 37 &amp; 16. 27. &amp;c.</note> iudgements we be ſubiect vnto: For theſe two will humble a man to the duſt. He that ſeeth his former perfection, what it was; and preſent miſery, what it is, cannot but be a man of ſorrow; and the law revealeth both. But a <hi>Iudas</hi> may goe thus farre; therefore the Goſpell muſt haue its ſtroke in this buſines; and that thus: when the Law like an hammer hath daſhed in pieces our hard hearts, then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes muſt come to make them melt and relent within vs; and that by a double act: the one is in the conſideration, how our ſinnes cauſed the onely ſonne of God to become accurſed: for a good Nature, hauing but a generall illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation cannot but be wounded at this conſideration, But yet we muſt paſſe another ſtep, ahd that is, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Gods mercy, in giuing vs his ſonne to dye for vs; and in aſſuring our hearts that all our ſinnes are freely pardoned; the many heavy iudgements, that we were lyable to, are for euer remoued, and our ſaluation ſealed to our ſoules; I ſay, when the remembrance hereof hath its ſtrong operation, and makes our hearts to melt in our bodies. The Law, like the mallet, breaketh the flinty heart; but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of the Goſpell, like a kind ſhower the earth, bringeth it to a good temper. For as the field that becomes fruitfull, muſt haue the firſt and ſecond raine after that its plowed and rent aſunder by the harrow; ſo muſt a new heart haue this twofold worke by the Law and gracious
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:972:191"/> promiſes contained in the Goſpell. We muſt not onely mourne, that our ſinnes be many, and the iudgments, we be lyable to, heauie: but alſo euen our bowells muſt yearne within vs, that Chriſt was crucified for vs, being an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon: and the Lords fauour worke mightily with vs, who hath declared vnto vs in particular, ſuch a depth of mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The new heart muſt be a pure and purging heart. For<note place="margin">Math 5. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> And this pure heart is procured by two meanes. 1. By getting of faith; for faith will purge, like barme in beere, and purifie the heart; it will cauſe that no corruption ſhall lodge or abide neere it. 2. A pure heart is obtained by this conſideration, that no vncleane heart ſhall inherit the kingdome of God: For euery thing, naturally, ſeekes it owne preſeruation, and this once vnderſtood, it will haue its operation. This new heart muſt be like a liuing ſpring.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A new heart muſt be a ſmiting heart; and that for the leaſt ſinne that's done in ſecret, knowne only to God, and our ſelues, aſwell as for great offences committed in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,<note place="margin">2 Sam 24. 10.</note> and in the view of many. <hi>Dauid</hi> had a new heart, and his had both theſe qualities; and it muſt ſmite. 1. For ſinnes of commiſſion. 2. Of omiſſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A new heart muſt be an vpright heart, and that is in regard of time or perſon: for time, alwaies endeavouring to be righteous: for perſon, 1. Before God. And 2. With all<note place="margin">Acts 24. 16.</note> men. <hi>And herein I doe endeauour my ſelfe alwayes to haue a good conſcience before God and before men.</hi> So that we ſee that new hearts muſt be 1. Broken hearts. 2. Purging hearts. 3. Smiting hearts. 4. Vpright hearts; and in ſuch an heart dwelleth the Spirit of God. Wherefore ſtrive thou for ſuch a one, and be thou aſſured, that the Spirit of God will come into thy heart, and dwell with thee for euer and euer. But if thine heart be not thus qualified, be not deceiued, the Holy Ghoſt ſhall neuer take one nightes abode in the manſion of thy ſoule; and on the contrary, thy heart will be but a Denne for that foule and vncleane ſpirit, the Deuill,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:972:192"/> who, if he poſſeſſe thy heart, will draw thee on into that fiery Lake, that burneth with fire and brimſtone for all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>I might here note another Doctrine, which is, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Spirit of God is an holy Spirit.</hi>

               <p>He is in many places ſo ſtiled in Scripture. 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 13. Eph. 4. 30. &amp;c.</hi> And he may be ſo called for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in that he proceedeth from the father and the Son,<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> the fountaine of all holines.</p>
               <p>Againe, he is coequall, coeſſentiall, coeternall with the<note place="margin" type="runSum">2.</note> Father and the Son. Therefore God, holy, yea holines it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And he worketh the beginning, progreſſe and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin" type="runSum">3.</note> of all holines in the Creature: And as he is oppoſed to Sathan that vncleane ſpirit, he is ſayd to be holy.</p>
               <p>Finally, he alwayes diſſwadeth from vncleannes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth<note place="margin" type="runSum">4.</note> to holines, as we may ſee in the holy Scriptures, which by the holy men of God, were penned, as they were carried by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Take we heed therefore, how we reſiſt or quench the<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> motions of this Spirit. For this is a fearefull ſinne, and to be avoyded, We read of ſome, that haue grieued, and deſpighted the holy Ghoſt; but the end of ſuch was neare vnto curſing and burning. And this may be done in our ſelues and others. What a lamentable thing is it, when gracious words proceede from mens mouthes, to heare one ſay; O Sir, I perceiue you are a Puritane, and one full of the Spirit? Doeſt thou this of ignorance? Why then thou art blame-worthy, to ſpeake euill of what thou knoweſt not: if of knowledge? the greater is thy offence, and ſeemeth to be a ſtep vnto that ſinne vnto death. Therefore in the name of God, deſpite not the Spirit of grace in thy ſelfe, or thy brother.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing this Spirit is holy, Let thoſe that enioy him<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2.</note> be carefull to keepe him; and them that want him to ſtriue for him; for he is worth the hauing. Holines is a thing
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:972:192"/> much to be reſpected, and cannot be had without the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And doe thou obſerue theſe directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When thou feeleſt and findeſt any ſecret motion ſtirred<note place="margin">How the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may be procured.</note> vp in thy heart to holines, entertaine it; prayſe God for it, and giue willing obedience therevnto. For there is almoſt no man, but at one time or other he ſhall heare a ſtill voice within him, ſaying, This is the way, walke in it: This muſt<note place="margin">Iſa. 30. 21:</note> be cheriſhed, greatly regarded. For if we put this from vs, peraduenture, when we would with all our hearts feele ſuch whiſperings, they will be wanting, and not eaſily come by.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Attend vpon the men of God in the Miniſtery of his word: For its ſayd, <hi>While Peter</hi> ſpake, and the people heard the holy Ghoſt fell vpon them. They that deny the meanes cannot expect this mercy. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 44.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. And in Concluſion: Speake not evill of thy brother; ſay not, he hath a Devill: This was the Phariſees fault, and<note place="margin">Mark. 3. 30.</note> in ſo doing (it ſeemes) they ſinned vnto death; For they told him, that he caſt out Devills by the Prince of Devills, when they thought otherwiſe; ſo that malice againſt the truth, being accompained with a ſound vnderſtanding of the truth, appeareth to be that irremiſſible ſinne.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Of which number bee Phygellus and Hermogenes.</hi>] From the nominating of theſe two, who, in all likelihood, were ſome principall perſons: we gather, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men of high place and much reſpect among the people of God,</hi>

                  <hi>Iudas</hi> did ſo, and <hi>Demas,</hi> with others. <hi>Pſal. 55. 13. 14. Act. 1. 17. 24. 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
               <p>And here it is to be conſidered, that there be diuers kinds of falling away. 1. When men fall from the profeſſion of Religion; firſt, either in reſpect of the precepts, and that totally, or in part: or ſecondly, in regard of power in the practice of Chriſtian duties. 2. When they maintain their former profeſſion, yet ſeparate from their brethren. 3. When men fall away for a time, yet recouer themſelues afterward. 4. And laſt of all, When its done by ſome vrgent neceſſity, or willingly. In many of theſe reſpects the beſt haue fallen,</p>
               <p>And God would haue it ſo,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the world may ſee, that the Lord can ſupport<note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p>And they be either, 1. inward, or 2. outward.</p>
               <p>The inward be foure eſpecially.</p>

               </p>

               <p>The outward cauſes are principally theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Perſecution: this hath turned millions backward,<note place="margin">Outward cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of falling away.</note> who in the daies of peace, had their faces to <hi>Sion-ward.</hi>
               </p>

Oh, but he might ſuggeſt, this thing is as hard as the other: Now <hi>Paul</hi> ſecretly grants him this; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tells him that he can no wayes doe that, but by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt. ver. 14. And hauing giuen him this good rule, leaſt his ſonne ſhould be puffed vp with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and omit all ſubordinate helpes, he tells him how many haue fallen away. ver. 15. for <hi>Timothy</hi> might thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue; Well; if the Holy Ghoſt be, and dwell in me, I will feare the leſſe; or he might be temped to be careleſſe, from that ground, for the preſeruation of theſe worthy things.

               <p>
                  <hi>True affection is of a ſpreading nature. Act. 26. 29. Rom.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> loued <hi>Oreſiphorus</hi> well, and from the head we ſee it enlarged it ſelfe to the whole houſe, all the members: Hence it is, that in the Scriptures it's compared to water; for loue is ſaid to be ſhed in the heart: or to oile, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 5. Pſal. 133. 1. &amp;c.</note> powred on the head, runneth downe all the garments. Certainely, he that in truth loueth the parents, cannot but affect the children.</p>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:972:203"/>
               <p>For at the firſt, it was ſo created. As the vnderſtanding<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> was to ſee all truth in all things; ſo was the affection fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to effect all things the which reaſon approued. Thoſe two were to be proportionable, like the patterne and the thing made by it. Now at our Regeneration Loue, in ſome degree, is reſtored to that perfection it had at the Creation, therefore ſpreadeth.</p>
               <p>Becauſe that <hi>Loue</hi> is nimble, ſubtile, actiue; therefore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> to fire that would conuert all contrary elements and ſubiects into its ſelfe. Its hotter then the coales of Iuniper; it compaſſeth the creatures as a garment; it will dilate it ſelfe farre and neere. For of all ſimple elements, fire is the moſt actiue, and ſpreadeth (as we may ſee by a candle) the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt; and ſo will true and feruent affection.</p>
               <p>Againe, Loue ſhouldreth out enuy, the which a pinching<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3.</note> and cold froſt, freezeth and holdeth things together, from ſpreading. Enuy would draw all good from others, to it ſelfe; but loue doth breake thoſe bonds, and ſets the heart at liberty.</p>
               <p>And is not Loue, true loue one of the moſt ſacred attributes<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 4.</note> in God? yea God is called Loue. And did not the Lord (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſin brake the condition) extend his affection to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Why then; a ſparke of that true fire in the creature, cannot but haue a large extent, a ſpreading operation.</p>
               <p>This may informe vs, what to judge of many in theſe<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> dayes; ſurely they haue little or none of this oyle, or fire abroad and kindled in their hearts; for if they had we ſhould fee it's ſpreading. We may truly ſay, with Chriſt, that <hi>Loue is waxen cold.</hi> Many boaſt much of it; but where ſhall we finde a faithfull, louing man? for all ſeeke their owne and not the good of their brethren. We haue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, <hi>Loue me, and loue my dog;</hi> I wiſh ſome did not more loue their dogs, then the Lords children.</p>
               <p>And by this doctrine, in the impartiall examination of<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2.</note> our ſelues, we may try the trueth of our Loue. Canſt thou, that art a Magiſtrate, ſay with <hi>Moſes; Oh!</hi> that there were ſuch an heart in my people to ſerue God? being a
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:972:204"/> preacher, canſt thou breake out with <hi>Paul, I would to God that all that heare me this day were ſuch as I am,</hi> the children of the Lord? Hath the Lord made thee a father, and canſt thou pray with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Noah, Oh that Iſmael might liue? and Iapheth dwell in the tents of Shem?</hi> that is, that my diſobedient ſeed might know the Lord God of their father, ſerue him, and be ſaued? you that are Gouernours of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, is it in your hearts and hands for you and your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to follow God? doe you labour, like <hi>Cornelius,</hi> that all your family might feare the Lord? And you that are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſons, doe you helpe one another to get grace and to grow vp in godlines? then this fire of true affection is from Gods owne altar deſcended on you, this loue is ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in your hearts; the oyle of amity hath annointed your garments, and you are of that number which with ioy vnſpeakeable ſhall one day behold the face of God. But if this deſired ſpreading be abſent, your hearts are ſtuffed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with hatred, cold envy hath benummed your ſubtile and actiue affections; and therefore take heed of this, that you be not found haters of God, and louers of pleaſure aboue him or his. If you be, heare your doome, <hi>Depart from me into euerlaſting fire, for I know you not;</hi> you did neuer viſit me in my members; cloath me, feede me, or build vp my decaied body, by prayer, inſtruction, example, nor in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore you haue no loue in you, neither ſhall ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any fauour at my hands, for the head and members make but one obiect.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt ſay vnto me. How farre will loue ſpread it<note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſt. Anſw.</note> ſelfe? <hi>Why;</hi> from God the Father, to all his children; Chriſt the head, to all his members; from the beginning of Gods booke to the laſt letter; in breife, from one end of the world, from one part of the large heauens, vnto the other; true loue would haue al ſexes, perſons, countries and kingdomes (ſo farre forth as it may ſtand with the will of God the Father) to be ſanctified and for euer bleſſed: for there is no bounds in loue: Affection (vnleſſe God chaine it, the which he may and doth for mans vnworthines) is without limits;
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:972:204"/> ſpreading it ſelfe from the externall conuexe of the higheſt throne round about, and thence deſcendeth to the earth's loweſt center; yea Loue embraceth the Lord who is infinite, incomprehenſible, ſo farre forth as ſound reaſon doth rightly guide it, direct it. It is a garment that doth cloth all creatures, and to the vttermoſt of its power, wrap with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its louely armes the eternall Creatour. He that findeth this in himſelfe, findeth a good thing; and but that very character which is imprinted in the heart of euery true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer and faithfull perſon.</p>
               <p>I might deduct another doctrine out of the matter of this petition, which is, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The mercy of God is principally to be deſired for our friends.</hi>

Wee may apply it to all things as well as to this particular: and that by the warrant of the Prophets and Apoſtles themſelues. Doeſt thou ſeeke after the Lord? doeſt thou deſire his fauour? cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thou for grace or mercy? cryeſt thou after wiſdome and vnderſtanding? followeſt thou after faith, loue, and the the like gifts? purſueſt thou, and preſſeſt thou the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> for wife, children, food, rayment, for earth and heauen? why feare not, but hope ſtill in the Lord, and thy
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:972:210"/> heart ſhall be ſatisfied with theſe things. But here let theſe rules be obſerued.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take the preſent time: <hi>Seeke the Lord while he may be</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rules to be obſerued in ſeeking.</note> 
                  <hi>found.</hi> The yong man muſt <hi>Remember his Creator in the daies of youth, leaſt the houres come wherein hee ſhall haue no pleaſure in them. Iezabel</hi> had a time, ſo had <hi>Ieruſalem, Agrippa</hi> and many others; but when they foreſlowed the oportunitie, they found not in future time any mercy. When God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and we will not come, we ſhall cry, but we ſhall not be heard. Wofull experience hath taught this truth to many thouſands; for there is an appointed time for all things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſunne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seeke for what thou wouldſt haue at the Lords hands, let him be the principall. <hi>Aſa</hi> was ſicke in his feete, <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> at the heart; the one ſeeking to the Phiſician firſt, died: the other going to God, had his life many yeares prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Goe not with <hi>Saul,</hi> to a witch at <hi>Endor;</hi> with <hi>Iudas,</hi> to the Phariſees: with <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> to <hi>Aſhur</hi> and<note place="margin">Hoſ. 5. 13.</note> king <hi>Iareb:</hi> with the Papiſt, to the Pope or Angell; But goe to the Lord; for theſe are miſerable comforters; and the beſt of them, if the God of all the world, the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of all things and chiefe Phiſician be abſent, cannot heale thee or cure thee of thy wound. But ſeek vnto God, and he will heare thee, helpe thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Goe to him; but not like the proud Phariſee, with <hi>I thanke God I am not ſo, nor ſo;</hi> neither with the boaſting Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, in the robes of thing owne righteouſnes; but come vnto him in the name of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of his loue;</hi> ſend him, or ſet him before thee: For whatſoeuer thou ſhalt ſeeke in his name, that is, in his worthines, it ſhall be giuen thee. For without Chriſt, he is a conſuming <hi>fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let the word, and that neuer-erring ſpirit be thy guide. If theſe two lead thee to the Father in the new and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing way of Chriſt the Sauiour of all that are ſaued, thou ſhalt find according to thy hearts deſire. Practiſe this Rule.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Haue reſpect to the manner of thy ſeeking; let it
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:972:211"/> be vpon the feete of faith and affection, with the wings of pure zeale and feruency, and then thou ſhalt find aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And finally, let the end of thy ſeeking be for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thy God; the good and comfort of thy brethren; and reformation of all thy wayes; the curing and curbing of thy ſtrong corruptions, the encreaſe of all grace: and for food, friends, favour and rayment ſo farre, and no farther, as the Lord ſeeth them to be needfull for thee. Obſerue theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and then ſtay the Lords leyſure, and be ſure of it, that as <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> found <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo ſhalt thou the thing thou haſt ſought after, be it what it can in earth or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>Now whereas <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> ſought <hi>Paul</hi> at Rome, and was permitted to refreſh him, we may note, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rome heathen was not ſobad then, as Rome Chriſtian is now.</hi>

               <p>For <hi>Paul</hi> might be ſuffered to liue, to haue his keeper<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> to leade him in a chaine, to dwell in a houſe; all that would were permitted to come vnto him; and without let he might preach the kingdome of God, the Goſpell of Chriſt; But now, if a <hi>Paul</hi> were there, he would not be thought worthy to liue, no not for an houre.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord.</hi>] In Hebrew, <hi>Adonai</hi> is <hi>Lord,</hi> being a word of<note place="margin">The Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the plurall number, yet often vſed in the forme ſingular: it is deriued of <hi>Aeden,</hi> a baſe or pillar which ſuſtaineth a thing: and our Engliſh word <hi>Lord,</hi> hath much like ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, being contracted of the old <hi>Saxon</hi> word <hi>Laford,</hi> which commeth of <hi>Laef,</hi> to ſupport, ſuſtaine or cheriſh; ſo that, <hi>Lord</hi> is a <hi>Suſtainer,</hi> refreſher, ſupporter, cheriſher. For if God withdraw his power, all things come to nothing. In the Greeke, it properly ſignifieth one that hath authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or on whoſe authoritie ſomething dependeth or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth: and ſo indeed doe all things depend on God, and hee is cheife gouernour and owner of all things created.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercy.</hi>] The word in the Hebrew put for mercy, doth import a ſacred affection of piety; fauour, benignitie, and bountifull good pleaſure or will of God towards a man, without reſpect of deſert or merit. It is alſo applied to man,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:972:212"/> and then it is meant, a pious, louing and benigne affection, whereby he is moued and inclined to doe good, to ſhew pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, compaſſion &amp;c. or that grace of God the which he hath receiued from the father through Chriſt, which is inherent in him; or conferred externally vpon him, and then its <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Iſai. 40. 6. &amp; 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 24. And it is frequent for the Greeks to vſe that word, which our Apoſtle doth here, for it; the which Chriſt himſelfe alloweth &amp; did practiſe. See <hi>Hoſ. 6. 6. Math.</hi> 9. 13. And the Hebrewes of <hi>Cheſed,</hi> which is <hi>Mercy</hi> call a godly man, <hi>chaſid,</hi> that is, gracious, mercifull. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 4. ſome read, <hi>a gracious Saint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With the Lord.</hi>] The like phraſe we read <hi>Gen. 19. 24. The Lord rained fire and brimſtone from the Lord. Paul</hi> vſeth the like manner of ſpeaking; for as iudgement came from the Lord vpon Sodom; ſo he prayes for mercy to befall <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiphorus</hi> from the Lord: Yet I haue thought, that <hi>Lord,</hi> in the firſt place, is to be vnderſtood of the Father; and in the ſecond, is meant the Sonne; for he is the iudge of the world: As if our Apoſtle had thus prayed; <hi>Now God the Father grant that Oneſiphorus may find mercy of his ſonne, at his appearing, vnto whom he hath committed all iudgement.</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> knew this, that Chriſt muſt iudge the world, &amp; might therefore diſtinguiſh thus in his vnderſtanding, when he prayed. But howeuer, the ſenſe is good and ſound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At that day.</hi>] Some thinke; at what time he ſhould alſo be afflicted; for at one time or other <hi>Paul</hi> thought he might alſo ſuffer for the Goſpell, though for the preſent he eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Others haue conceiued, at the day of death: I rather would take it to be meant, at the day of iudgement; for then is the righteous rewarded for his workes; and that is a day, wherein, if it goe well with vs, it will be well with vs for euer. And its vſuall for good men, to haue their minds in trouble, ſet vpon that obiect of the generall freedome from all miſery, and fruition of all felicity.</p>
               <p>

They be the great Booke of God, alwayes vnfolded, wherein the wicked might reade his power, Deitie, and wonders, if they would: they are oftentimes puniſhed for mans offences; the earth is barren, groning like a woman with childe, yet cannot bring forth her fruite; the Sea rageth, and the ſprings are dryed vp; the beaſts of the field mourne; the fiſh of the waters die and ſmell; the fowles of the ayre periſh, and the very heauens become as braſſe: The good Angels are, till then, miniſtring ſpirits, take many a iourney from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to earth, place to place, and from perſon to perſon, to comfort and kill, preſerue and ſlay: And ſome (but without grounds) haue conceiued, that they mooue, vntill that day, the Orbes and celeſtiall ſpheares: when as it's probable, no ſuch things be: For thus I would reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

And if they hold, they be more ſubtill then the fire (aboue which they ſay, they are placed): then how can the ſtars be fixed in them, for wee cannot fallen them in the ayre, much leſſe then in a fine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. We ſee fiſhes in the ſea, beaſts placed on the earth,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:972:213"/> fowles in the ayre, and Angels in heauen: Why then ſhould the element of fire bee created to bee voyd, ſince euery ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is repleniſhed with its proper and peculiar creatures? Earthly bodies be on earth; watery bodies in water; aiery, in the ayre, heauenly, in heauen; ſo that by proportion &amp; method, the Sunne, Moone, and Starres ſhould be in the element of fire; and running their circular and ſwift mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they caſt downe the fire, which otherwiſe of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would not deſcend; participating more of fire, (and being without ſenſe, for otherwiſe the fire would conſume them) then any other element: For if we marke, we ſhall ſee the Lord doth maruailouſly fit euery creature for its ſubiect. And this may ſeeme to bee the reaſon, why the Moone is ſpotted and no planet beſides; in that ſhe runnes her motion in the very ebbe (as I may ſay) and dregs of the element of fire: for the pureſt, as we ſee in water, is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. And why the ſtarres neereſt the Poles, doe twinckle and looke bright, may alſo be, in that the fire, being moued there by the reflexe, doth enlighten them more fully. And whereas ſome ſeeme to wander, it is not becauſe they are not mooued with a circular Motion; but they come ſhort, going a leſſer compaſſe, and therefore we thinke that they goe forward and backward. We may ſee the truth of this in thoſe people, that, in diuerſe pathes one diſtant from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, doe runne with a circular motion about a poſt or pole.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the poſition of thoſe that doe maintaine Orbes, and Epicicles, that, <hi>No violent motion is perpetuall;</hi> how then, if the Angels or Intelligences did moue the Orbes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they hold the ſtarres be fixed, ſhould this motion bee ſo conſtant, permanent?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Finally, God made euery creature very good, able by an internall faculty or principle to accompliſh its end: Why then ſhould not the ſtarres haue this power by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as well as other things? So that, it ſeemes they haue a kinde of motiue ſoule; as all other creatures that mooue haue either a vegetatiue, ſenſitiue, or reaſonable ſoule. This
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:972:214"/> that I hold is no new opinion; and there be many ſtrong reaſons, by learned Philoſophers, to proue it; the which I omit, only alleadging ſuch as I my ſelfe haue conceiued: And if it be a truth that they alſo hold, that now the Sunne is nearer the earth by many degrees then in former time, it will follow, that there is a vacuity in Nature, which they deny: for the Orbes doe alſo deſcend, and what ſupplieth the place? But we omit this as ſomewhat intricate, and not much edifiable, and render other Reaſons of the doctrine.</p>
               <p>And this day muſt be, in regard of the wicked and godly<note place="margin" type="runSum">

Yet the remembrance of this day did cauſe them to endure the croſſe, deſpiſe the ſhame, reſiſt vnto bloud, and neuer to deny their innocency to the death. And this ought for to worke the ſame glorious effects in vs, when we are croſſed and curſed of Turke and Pope, Papiſts and Deuills.

For what an immeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obiect of wrath and indignation diſcouereth it ſelfe to all ſuch? when the earth ſhall tremble, the mountaines, like men frighted, ſhall skip out of their ſetled places, the ſea roare, the waters boyle like an hot and raging cauldron, the Sunne be turned into bloud, the ſtarres fall; (as the tree that after a pinching froſt, caſteth her leaues and fruit,) from the firmament; and the whole frame of Nature flame with fire; yea the heauens themſelues ſhrivle and paſſe away as a paper ſcroule, and all the elements, from the loweſt depth to the higheſt aſcent, ſhall melt with heate, and burne like a fornace: I ſay, when theſe things ſhall be, where will the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly and the ſinners appeare? Now ſhall the drunkard, drinke the deepeſt violls of the Lords vengeance, ſpue and fall, and neuer riſe any more: the Fornicatour and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, ſhall burne in torment, the very marrow of their bones ſhall frie, and their proud fleſh be conſumed by fire: the Vſurer and Couetous man, ſhall haue their gold and ſiluer to eate vp their fleſh like ruſt, and their thicke clay, falſly got, ſhall preſſe them downe to the nethermoſt hell; the Epicure, and dainty feeding perſon ſhall be pinched with hunger and thirſt; and ſhall not haue ſo much as one drop of cold water to coole their tongues: the ſwearer, who hath dipt his tongue red in the wounds of Chriſt, ſhall be pierced through with many ſorrowes: In a word, that ſoule, which hath bathed it's ſelfe in the pleaſures of ſinne without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſhall die the ſecond death. Wherefore, while it is
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:972:215"/> called to day, returne and cauſe others to returne, that you may eſcape the dreadfull and importable wrath to come. But alas! wicked men, for all that man or God can ſay or threaten, they are like <hi>Iobs</hi> horſe, <hi>Iob</hi> 39. 21. &amp;c. they walke in the valley of ſinne, and reioyce in their ſtrength of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; they goe out to meet the harneſſed man Chriſt with the reuenging Scepter of iuſtice in his hand; they ſwallow and breake the ground of Gods precepts with their fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; they account braſſe as ſtraw, iron as rotten wood; they thinke that they can drinke vp (as the Leviathan doth <hi>Iordan</hi>) the Riuers of Gods wrath with their mouthes; they ſmell this great battell afarre off, and cry, <hi>Ha, ha,</hi> at the ſound of the laſt trumpet, and ſay, Tuſh wee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee mooued, the Lord neither thinketh good or euill. But for all this, God, who ſits on high, hath girded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the garment of vengeance, his ſword is whetted, his bow bent, he will therefore make his ſhafts drunke with their purple blood, and will for euer haue them in deriſion.

In all thy croſſes, wrongs, iniuries, troubles, perſecutions, ſickneſſes, and in the houre of death, look vp to this hill, ſoare to this height, and haue this continually in thy remembrance. For now ſhall thy wounds bee cured, thy infirmities healed, thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies reuenged, and all thy honeſt workes rewarded: Now ſhall Sathan bee trod vnder thy foot, his inſtruments bound in euerlaſting chaines of darkeneſſe, and thou with thy Lord and Maſter Chriſt, bee carried into the holy of holies, filled with ioy, and bathe thy ſoule in the riuers of pleaſure for all eternity. All the men of God, in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt anguiſh here below, haue fetched comfort by the eye

Let the minde of the righteous wander whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will or can, this will bee the ſpring where to coole its thirſt, the poole to waſh away its filthineſſe, the ſtay whereon to reſt, like the Arke on Mount <hi>Ararat,</hi> after all its ſtormes and tempeſts. This is the acceptable day of the Lord, the yeere of Iubilee, and the very time when all things, in an vnchangeable, eternall, and neuer-fading condition, ſhall be ſetled, eſtabliſhed.

<pb n="433" facs="tcp:972:220"/> which the Papiſt doth defend, hath cauſed me to doubt more of their finall good eſtate then this.

                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:972:221"/> the yeere of <hi>Iubilee?</hi> and the marriage of the Lambe and his beloued? Shall not the Diuell and all his ſoule ſpirits, that haue perſecuted the Saints of God, be rewarded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they haue rewarded vs? and all the faithfull take poſſeſſion of that glorious and immortall kingdom, where they ſhal all with one tongue and heart, with ioy vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious, ſing glory to God, praiſe to the Lambe, without the leaſt inward oppoſition or interruption; the which is their chiefe deſire, that heere on earth they ayme at: that wherein their greateſt bleſſedneſſe conſiſteth for euermore?

Many men in the Inne of this world, are like the ſwaggerers and prodigals in a Tauerne, who call freely, eate and drinke, laugh and are fat, but neuer minde either the reckoning, or the time of harueſt; for they haue ſowne no good ſeed, neither haue wherewith to diſcharge the ſhot: therefore ſuffer theſe things willingly to ſlip, and abſent themſelues out from their mindes, becauſe they haue, or can expect no commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity by either. But the faithfull man is of a contrary mind; for he is ſparing in expence, and hath ſcattered much good graine, the which will bring a goodly crop at his Maſters appearing; the great day of reaping, both of which cauſe him often to looke vpward.</p>
               <p>And by this Doctrine wee may proue whether wee bee<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2.</note> like minded, or not, to the moſt faithfull perſon. Doeſt thou againe and againe thinke on this day? Is thy minde often carried to this obiect? So areſt thou on high, with the wings of faith and a ſound eye to this hill? why then thou art a right bird, truely bred, and not of the baſtard brood. Euery croſſe, baſe imputation, falſe report, ach in the ioynts, corruption in the fleſh and ſpirit; each good action,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:972:221"/> faithfull prayer, motion of true affection towardes Chriſt and his members, heauen and holineſſe will carry the mind of him or her that's truely religious, vpright hearted, to this Mountaine, Marriage day, and time of refreſhing. So that, findeſt thou this in thy ſelfe, then be of good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort: for thou art of the Brides company, and one that ſhall ſee the euerlaſting light, ſit downe and reape ioy and gladnes, life and glory in the largeſt fields of Gods goodneſſe, the heauenly Canaan, the new Ieruſalem which is aboue. But if thou art deſtitute of theſe kinde of motions, eleuations; then ſtriue for theſe properties that are the inſeparable brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things and mouings of an holy heart, ſound minde, and bleſſed perſon. The very frame of nature ſtretcheth forth her necke, and peepeth vpward to this ſeaſon.

               <p>It may be obiected that <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to haue his name<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiect.</note> blotted out of the booke of life: <hi>Paul,</hi> to be accurſed and ſeparated from Chriſt, both of which are impoſſible.</p>

Learne the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gods promiſes; know them (as it were) by name, and then aske what the Lord hath promiſed, and he will giue it thee. Care not how many they be for multitude, how great for ſubſtance and worth; for they bee all true, and but the rule of faith and prayer; and the more excellent fauours the Lord ſhall giue thee, the greater glory ſhall he haue, and his children good. As thou maiſt not dare to aske what he hath not promiſed; ſo neuer feare to pray for what he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; but open thy mouth wide, and he ſhall fill it. Come not ſhort, neither goe beyond the rule, and thou canſt not erre. A Logician, Grammarian, Rhetorician, and every Artiſt muſt know all his precepts and practiſe them: So muſt a good Chriſtian be acquainted with euery promiſe, and pray as they ſhall direct him. I would haue this leſſon<note place="margin">Directions for prayer.</note> well learned of euery perſon: And take theſe helpes for thy direction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, that the promiſes are of this life or the life to come; temporall things, craue conditionaly; eternall, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All that the Lord hath promiſed, or that is contained in his promiſes, is either the remotion of euill, or the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of good. And euill is, either the euill of ſinne, or of puniſhment: Good is, either carnall things or ſpirituall. And in theſe heads, or within theſe particulars are all things comprehended that thou art to pray for, or againſt. Now thou art to petition for thy ſelfe, or thy brethren; for bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to fall on thy ſelfe, or the elect; or curſings on the reprobate: For that which is a threat to the wicked is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the faithfull; becauſe when iudgments befall the prophane, it is good ſome way for Gods glory, or to his children. But let theſe things be wiſely vnderſtood, warily practiſed.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, from this example of the Apoſtle, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many fauours, yet hauing not in the ſame kind to make

                  <hi>pray vnto God for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This hath beene the practice of all the faithfull. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
               <p>For by prayer we may preuaile with God, ſo that they may<note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> receiue greater favours; we in ſo doing may procure them ſpirituall bleſſings, or an increaſe of the ſame ſubſtance, wherewith we by them haue beene releeued, refreſhed.</p>
               <p>Againe, what if we ſhould not? yet in the performance of<note place="margin" type="runSum">

Prayer hath a large extent: pouerty doth not depriue a man of this priuiledge; neither take away the preſence of Gods Spirit, or the vertue of his promiſes. Truly, this cannot but comfort an honeſt and thankfull heart, and pricke him forward to this way of requitall.</p>
               <p>And this ſhould teach thoſe, that haue contributed to the<note place="margin" type="runSum">

                  <hi>Paul</hi> had beene often refreſhed by this his friend; therfore praieth for him in particular; ſo he did for others, who haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him kindly. See to this purpoſe. <hi>Luk. 22. 32. Eph. 6. 19. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the law of God and Nature warrant it. As much is to<note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p>This Doctrine ſemeth to diſcouer a fault in them, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies<note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p>And it doth teach vs a twofold leſſon. 1. To obſerue &amp;<note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p n="2">2. Let children be mindfull of their parents, who, next to God, haue giuen them a beeing, and preſeruation.

Let ſuch take heede, that <hi>Cain's</hi> curſe doe not befall them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The people muſt not forget their Paſtors: For they

But this is not the cuſtome of our countrimen; they, of all others, care leaſt, pray leaſt for their Preacher; and hence it often falleth out, that God remoues their candleſtick, tyeth the the tongue of their ſpirituall Father, that he ſpeakes not to their comfort; or ſends ſome heauy iudgement vpon them for the omiſſion of this dutie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And in concluſion; <hi>Ionathan</hi> muſt be remembred of <hi>Dauid;</hi> euery priuate friend muſt pray for another: Pray (I pray you) for all men in generall, but eſpecially for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Preachers, Parents and principall friends in particular: for this is the Law and the Prophets.</p>
